# Can GravityRevisions track changes to a Gravity Forms form?

No, GravityRevisions does not track changes to a Gravity Forms form. The GravityRevisions plugin only tracks (and restores) changes to the **entries** created by a form.

Please [let us know](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/) if this functionality is essential to you. If this functionality were developed, here are some of the features it would have:

- See changes to the form fields
- View changes in field settings
- Identify updates in Confirmation and Notification settings
- Restore prior form settings
