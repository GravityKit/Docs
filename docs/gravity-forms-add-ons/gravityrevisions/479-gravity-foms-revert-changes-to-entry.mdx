# How to restore field values with the GravityRevisions plugin



### I see a value has changed in a Gravity Forms entry, and I want to revert it.

My old entry value was perfect, and I want it back!

Go to the "Forms" menu in the WordPress sidebar, click on Entries, then click on the entry from which you wish to restore an old field value.

### Below an entry's "Notes" box is the "Entry Revisions" box

The Entry Revisions box displays a list of all the changes made to an entry.

To see what field values changed (or to restore those values), click the link.

### Choose the fields you want to keep and restore

You can quickly select all fields by checking the box at the top or the bottom of the table.

### Click the "Restore These Values" button

Once you have selected the values you wish to restore, click the "Restore These Values" button.

### Now the current entry values include the restored field values
