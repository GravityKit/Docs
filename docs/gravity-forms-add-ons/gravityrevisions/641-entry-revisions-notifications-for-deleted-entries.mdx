# Can GravityRevisions notify me when an entry is deleted?

While the [GravityRevisions](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/entry-revisions/) plugin does allow you to be [notified by email when an entry is updated](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/485-email-notify-entries-updated-gravity-forms), it is not currently possible for the plugin to trigger a notification when an entry is deleted.
