# GravityRevisions Merge Tags

GravityRevisions comes with Merge Tags you can use in Gravity Forms notifications:

| Merge Tag | Description |
|---|---|
| `{entry_revision_all_fields}` | A pre-formatted table of all submitted values **of the most recent revision**. Looks exactly like the [Gravity Forms {all\_fields} Merge Tag](https://docs.gravityforms.com/fields-merge-tag/), and supports all the {all\_fields} Merge Tag modifiers. |
| `{entry_revision_diff}` | A side-by-side comparison of the fields that have changed between the current entry and the **most recent entry revision**. |
| `{entry_revision_list}` | A bulleted list of changes made to an entry over time.         Each change displays a thumbnail-sized image of the user who made the change, the date the change was made, and a link to restore the entry values from that change. |

#### If no revision exists

If there are no revisions for an entry, the above Merge Tags will output "This entry has no revisions."

#### Embedded CSS

When Merge Tags are included in email notifications, the styles that make the table look *super nice* are added to the output of the Merge Tag. To disable that, you can [add this code to your functions.php file](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples):

```css
// Don't embed <style> tags in the Merge Tag output
add_filter( 'gravityview/entry-revisions/embed-css', '__return_false' )
```
