# Can I use [gravitymath] with [gvlogic]?

The answer to the question "Can I use \[gravitymath\] with \[gvlogic\]?" is: it depends on what you mean.

### If you want to place \[gravitymath\] shortcodes inside \[gvlogic\] shortcodes, you can.

This code:

```
[gvlogic if="1" is="100"] <br>
 One plus two equals: [gravitymath] 1 + 2 [/gravitymath] <br>
[else]
 One hundred and twenty times two equals: [gravitymath] 120 * 2 [/gravitymath] 
[/gvlogic]
```

Will output as:

> One plus two equals: 3

### If you meant "Can I use \[gv\_math\] output as parameters for my \[gvlogic\] shortcode?", the answer is no.

This won't work:

```
[gvlogic if="3" is="[gravitymath] 1 + 2 [/gravitymath]"] His logic is sound. [/gvlogic]
```

The reason is a recent change to WordPress itself. Because of a security issue, WordPress made a change so that you are not able to use another shortcode to call a shortcode. Because of this, the `[gvlogic]` shortcode no longer supports passing the output of the `[gravitymath]` shortcode inside it.
