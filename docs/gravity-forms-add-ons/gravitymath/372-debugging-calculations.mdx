# Debugging Calculations in GravityM​ath



### Having issues?

If your shortcode is not showing anything, or the output is not correct, add `debug="true"` to the shortcode, as shown.

#### Example of debugging messages

When you enable debug mode, you will see a link displayed where the shortcode was placed, and a report at the bottom of the page with additional details. In the example provided, `scope="entry"` was not added to the `[gravitymath]` shortcode.
