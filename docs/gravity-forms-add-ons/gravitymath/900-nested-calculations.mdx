# Nested calculations in GravityMath

GravityMath allows you to perform advanced calculation on your Gravity Forms data using the [\[gravitymath\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/295-math-shortcode).

For example, this shortcode adds two values together and divides them by 365:

```
[gravitymath scope="form" id="52"] ( {Number:1} + {Number:3} ) / 365 [/gravitymath]
```

## Creating complex calculations by nesting multiple shortcodes

With GravityMath 2.2, you can nest multiple `[gravitymath]` shortcodes. In other words, you can add a `[gravitymath]` shortcode inside another `[gravitymath]` shortcode! This allows you to use data from multiple forms in one calculation.

**Here's an example**: we're using two different forms to calculate the amount due from a client for support questions (billed at $100/question) and VIP support requests (billed at $200/request) respectively. The below calculation adds these values together.

```
Total due from client: $[gravitymath] 
 [gravitymath2 scope="form" id="12"] {Support Questions:2:count} * 100 [/gravitymath2] + [gravitymath2 scope="form" id="4"] {VIP Support Requests:4} * 200 [/gravitymath2]
[/gravitymath]
```


:::danger

⚠️ You cannot use the same shortcode inside itself: the closing tag ( `[/gravitymath]`) will stop the shortcode from processing! Use `[gravitymath2]`, `[gravitymath3]` instead.
