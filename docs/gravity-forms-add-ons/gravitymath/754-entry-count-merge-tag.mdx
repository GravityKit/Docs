# The {entry_count} Merge Tag in Math by GravityView

When creating Gravity Forms calculations with the [GravityMath add-on](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/math), it's often important to know how many total entries are used in the calculation.

Use the `{entry_count}` Merge Tag inside a `[gravitymath]` shortcode to help calculate averages.

### Average order value of my Gravity Forms form

The shortcode below will take the total value of the Product field and divide it by the number of entries.

`[gravitymath scope="form" id="123"]{Product:1:sum} / {entry_count}[/gravitymath]`


:::caution

Note: `{entry_count}` here is the same as `{entry_count:form}` because it uses the scope value passed by the shortcode (`scope="form"`)

:::

 ## Scopes

`{entry_count}` will switch automatically between three numbers based on the `scope` attribute used in the `[gravitymath]` shortcode:

- Form
- View
- Visible

## A Gravity Forms Merge Tag that shows the number of entries in a form

To show the number of entries in a Gravity Forms form, use `{entry_count:form}` The number of entries in a Gravity Forms form (not spam or in the trash).

## The `{entry_count}` Merge Tag to show the number of entries in a Viewâ€”or currently visible in a View

The Merge Tag also includes "modifiers" that allow you to display different information.

- `{entry_count:visible}` The number of visible entries in a View
- `{entry_count:view}` The number of total entries for a View (or search result)
