# How to target a specific field value with [gravitymath] filters


:::danger

The "filter" parameter only works with `scope="view"` or `scope="form"`. More about that here: [The \[gravitymath\] Shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/295-math-shortcode).

:::



Assuming you have a form like this one:

...and a View like this one:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5cef1e420428637b2ee7d375/file-DSQ3TePMYq.png)

Now, you want to calculate the sum between Number 1 and Number 2, only for the entries where the value of the Calculate field is "Yes". That's now possible with the "filter" parameter of the \[gravitymath\] shortcode.

Here's our shortcode:

```
Total: [gravitymath scope="view" id="8" filter="filter_1=Yes&op_1=is"]{Number 1:2}+{Number 2:3}[/gravitymath]
```

...and here's the output in the View:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5cef1ee70428637b2ee7d379/file-OmCmE1PWb3.png)

### Usage

The following attributes for the "filter" parameter are supported:

filter\_N - the filter, where N is the ID of the field or meta key  
`op_N` - the operation for a corresponding `filter_N`, default: `is`, other operators are `isnot`, `contains`, `notcontains`, `lt` (less than), and `gt` (greather than).  
`limit` - the number of entries to calculate. Leave it blank to use all entries from the chosen "scope" parameter.

In the example below, we are filtering the field Calculate (ID = 1) for the "Yes" value.

```
[gravitymath scope="view" id="206" filter="filter_1=Yes&op_1=is"]...[/gravitymath]
```

If we wanted to filter by two fields instead, for example, Calculate =Yes and Number 2 = 6, then we'll do it like this:

```
[gravitymath scope="view" id="206" filter="filter_1=Yes&op_1=is&filter_3=Yes&op_3=is"]...[/gravitymath]
```

Pay attention to the fact that filter\_1 and op\_1 correspond to the first field Calculate (ID = 1), and filter\_3 and op\_3 correspond to the field Number 2 (where ID = 3).

### Use values on the filter parameter, not labels

If you are filtering a choice-based field, like a dropdown, that uses values instead of only labels, then the filter will look for the value and not the label:

Example:

```
[gravitymath ... filter="filter_1=first_choice"]...[/gravitymath]
```

### When filtering product field choices, use the "contains" operator

Product field choices are stored in the database as `value|price`; therefore, when trying to filter for specific choices, use `contains` as the filter operator.

```
[gravitymath scope="view" id="206" filter="filter_1=Cheese&op_1=contains"]...[/gravitymath]
```
