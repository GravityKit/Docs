# Adding a GravityCharts Widget to GravityView

GravityCharts integrates with [GravityView](https://www.gravitykit.com/features/), allowing you to add charts to your front-end applications.

First, ensure that you have created at least one chart for the form attached to your View. Next, edit your View, click the 'Add Widget' button and select the GravityCharts widget.

Here you can select the chart you want to embed and choose whether to display data from all entries or only those visible on the page. You can also set a max height and width for your chart.
