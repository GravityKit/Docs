# Chart Design and Styling

GravityCharts includes an extensive range of customization options that allow you to tweak the look and feel of your charts before setting them live on your site.

After editing your GravityCharts feeds, You'll find the style options in the Chart Configuration panel above the chart preview. There are four design menus - "Colors", "Design", "Title &amp; Legend", and "Axis".

Click on one of the design tabs to see the available options. After opening one of the tabs, you can click to drag and drop the panel anywhere on your screen.
