# Image charts for GravityCharts


:::caution

**This feature is currently in beta!** If you encounter any issues, please let our support know.

:::



The GravityCharts "Image Charts" feature (currently in beta) is powered by [QuickChart](https://quickchart.io).

These images of charts can be embedded in a post, page, email, or PDF generated by Gravity PDF using the [`[gravitycharts embed_type="image"]` shortcode attribute](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/850-gravitycharts-shortcode) throughout WordPress and by using the [`{gravitycharts}` Merge Tag](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/857-gravitycharts-merge-tag) inside Gravity Forms.

## Uptime

We do not guarantee uptime or server responsiveness. We are hosting an instance of QuickChart to provide a more reliable service than likely provided by the free QuickChart service.

If you require better uptime, we recommend signing up for [QuickCharts Professional plan](https://quickchart.io/pricing/).

## Image charts are not dynamic

Images of charts represented the chart data **when the image was generated**. If the data changes, the image will not update. If an email contains an image of a chart, the image will not update when the form data changes.

## Terms of service/privacy policy

Image generation requests are made to quickchart.io, a service not controlled by GravityKit. By using the image charts functionality, you agree to their [Terms of Service](https://quickchart.io/terms-of-service) and [Privacy Policy](https://quickchart.io/privacy-policy). GravityKit makes no representations of the service provided by QuickChart.io.

If you prefer to use a self-hosted version of QuickChart, that is possible by [updating the host value using the API](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/855-customizing-image-charts).
