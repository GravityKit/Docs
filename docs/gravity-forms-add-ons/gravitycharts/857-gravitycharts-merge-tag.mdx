# The {gravitycharts} Merge Tag


:::caution

**This feature is currently in beta!** If you encounter any issues, please let our support know.

:::



GravityCharts has a [Gravity Forms Merge Tag](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/), `{gravitycharts}` that will be replaced by a static image of a chart feed.

The structure of the Merge Tag is:

` {gravitycharts:[feed id]:[shortcode attributes]} `

**Merge Tag Attributes:**

- `[feed id]` is the ID of the chart feed.
- `[shortcode attributes]` Optional. An ampersand-separated list of shortcode attributes that will override default values (see examples below).

## Merge Tag examples

### Display chart feed #123

This Merge Tag will be replaced by an image of chart feed #123 using the default width of an image chart (500px) and the default height of an image chart (300px).

`{gravitycharts:123}`

### Setting chart width and height

It is possible to override the width and height of the image chart because the [`[gravitycharts]` shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/850-gravitycharts-shortcode) has `width` and `height` attributes. Using the attribute formatting supported by shortcodes in WordPress, you can override the defaults by passing `width=500&height=250` to the Merge Tag:

` {gravitycharts:123:width=500&height=250} `

This Merge Tag will now be replaced by an image 500px wide and 250px tall.

Note that a colon is added between the chart feed ID and the shortcode attributes. This is required.
