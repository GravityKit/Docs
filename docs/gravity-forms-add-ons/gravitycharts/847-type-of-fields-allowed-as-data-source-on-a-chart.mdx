# Type of Fields Allowed as Data Source on a Chart

In GravityCharts, only certain types of fields are allowed to be used as the data source for a chart.

These fields all have one thing in common, they allow for choices: Drop Down, Multi-Select Drop Down, Radio Buttons, and Checkboxes.

Our charts add-on also support these same fields from the [Survey add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/survey/).


:::info

Only one field can be used at this moment to generate a chart. You can create multiple charts for the same form by creating multiple feeds (1 feed = 1 chart).
