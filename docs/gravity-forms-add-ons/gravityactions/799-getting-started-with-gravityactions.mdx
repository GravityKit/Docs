## Hereâ€™s how bulk editing entries works

On the Gravity Forms Entries page, please select all the entries you want to modify and then select the **Bulk Edit Entries** option on the *Bulk Actions* drop-down:

Once you the **Apply** button, this modal window will pop up asking you to select which fields you want to modify in bulk:

After selecting which fields you want to modify in bulk and clicking **Next**, this next screen will show up asking for you to input the new values into the selected fields:

Type the new values into the selected fields and click on the "Review changes to x fields" button to proceed to the final step:

In this latest step, the screen will show you how many entries will be updated and the number of fields affected. If everything is correct, press the **Update Entries** button to finish the process.

That's it! You just easily updated the values of some fields in hundreds of entries in seconds.
