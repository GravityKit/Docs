# Import Step: Where would you like to import the entries?


:::info

Don't worry: You can change your selection after you make it.

:::



If you want to **add entries to an existing form**, choose "An Existing Form". You will be able to add new fields to the form.

If you want to **update existing entries**, choose "An Existing Form".

If you want to import entries into a **form that doesn't exist** on the site, choose "Create a New Form".

If you are unsure whether a form exists or not, click "An Existing Form". You will see a list of active forms. If the form is not available in that list, you can change your selection later.
