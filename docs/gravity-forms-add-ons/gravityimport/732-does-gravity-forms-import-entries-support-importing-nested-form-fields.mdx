# Does GravityImport support importing Nested Form fields?

Unfortunately, no. Importing forms containing [Nested Form fields](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-nested-forms/) are not yet supported by our plugin.

GravityView [does support](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/583-does-gravityview-support-gp-nested-forms-gravity-wiz-perk) displaying those fields on a View.
