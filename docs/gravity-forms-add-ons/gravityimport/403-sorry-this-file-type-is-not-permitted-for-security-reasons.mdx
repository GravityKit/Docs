# Error: CSV file failed to upload

For security purposes, WordPress only allows you to [upload certain file types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Uploading_Files) by default. If you're getting the error message below, you can use one of the following WordPress plugins to allow CSV and other file types to be uploaded:

- [Disable Real MIME Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-real-mime-check/)
- [WP Add Mime Types](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-add-mime-types/)


:::danger

CSV file failed to upload. Sorry, you are not allowed to upload this file type.
