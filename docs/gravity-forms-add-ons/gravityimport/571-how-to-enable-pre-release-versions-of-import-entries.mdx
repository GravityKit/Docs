# How to enable pre-release versions of GravityImport

At GravityKit, we're always working on updates to plugins. If you'd like early access to plugins before they're 100% complete ("beta" access), here's how:

![Image showing the WordPress dashboard and the steps described below](https://i.gravitykit.com/n39KLl+)

1. Click on Forms in the WordPress dashboard sidebar
2. Click on the Settings link in the Forms menu
3. Click on the link labeled Import Entries
4. Check the checkbox labeled "Receive pre-release updates"
5. Click Update Settings to save the settings

You are now set to receive pre-release updates for the GravityImport plugin! Go to your site's Plugins page to see if there is a new update available.
