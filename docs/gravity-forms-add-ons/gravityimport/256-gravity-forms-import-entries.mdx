#### 8.1 Ignore Required Form Fields

This setting is only visible if you import data into a form with required fields. This setting will allow you to import rows from your CSV that do not contain the required fields.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5d39da9a2c7d3a2ec4bf6b82/file-gGYFJR4L2S.png)

#### 8.2 Process Feeds

If your form has feeds configured, this setting allows you to trigger the feed for each imported entry. Each entry will be sent to the checked feeds. Of your feeds are configured with conditions, those conditions will be respected when processing each entry.

![Process Feeds setting on the Configure screen is checked. There are two feed providers shown, with multiple checkboxes that allow the user to select which feed to process when importing entries.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5d39e75c2c7d3a2ec4bf6c4c/file-A7ow0lOJar.png)

#### 8.3 Continue Processing If Errors Occur

With this setting enabled, if the importer encounters a problem with the CSV, it will not stop the import. It will continue processing all the rows of your CSV file and then provide a report of the errors encountered.

####  8.4 Conditional Import 

If you want to filter the imported entries based on their values, you can do so by using the "Conditional Import" setting.
