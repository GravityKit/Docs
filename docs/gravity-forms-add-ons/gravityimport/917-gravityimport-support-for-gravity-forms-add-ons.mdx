# GravityImport Support for Gravity Forms Add-Ons


:::caution

It is important to note that the support for special fields created by other Gravity Forms Add-ons **is limited to entry importing only**.   
The "[Create a New Form](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/605-create-new-gravity-form-csv)" functionality is only available for Gravity Forms standard fields.

:::



Here's a list of the current GravityImport support for existing Gravity Forms Add-Ons:

## Polls [ðŸ”—](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/polls/)

All Poll fields (Drop Down, Radio Buttons, and Checkboxes) are supported except the use of the "Other" choice on Radio Buttons, which is not supported:

## Survey [ðŸ”—](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/survey/)

Survey unique fields are fully supported: Likert (with or without Multiple Rows and with or without Scoring enabled), Rank, and Rating.

The other fields: Radio Buttons, Checkboxes, Single Line Text, Paragraph Text, and Drop Down are all supported as well, by default.

GravityImport does not support importing the Survey Total Score entry meta, which is not required to generate Survey Results for the form.

## Quiz [ðŸ”—](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/quiz/)

All Quiz fields (Drop Down, Radio Buttons, and Checkboxes) are supported.

GravityImport does not support importing the Quiz Score Total, Quiz Percentage, Quiz Grade, and Quiz Pass/Fail entry meta, which are not required to generate Quiz Results for the form.
