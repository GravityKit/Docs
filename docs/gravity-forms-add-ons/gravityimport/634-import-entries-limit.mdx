# Does GravityImport limit the number of entries I can import?

The GravityImport plugin does not limit the number of entries you can import.

If you're having trouble importing a large number of entries at once, this could be due to server restrictions, bandwidth limits, etc. Please try splitting your CSV file into 2 or more files then importing in smaller batches.
