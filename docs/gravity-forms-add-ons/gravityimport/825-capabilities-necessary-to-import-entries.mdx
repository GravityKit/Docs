These are the minimum capabilities necessary to allow a WordPress User to import entries using our [GravityImport](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravity-forms-entry-importer/) plugin.

The screenshots above are from the [Members â€“ Membership &amp; User Role Editor Plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/), which we recommend to manage capabilities in WordPress.

The ["Read" capability](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#read) is necessary for the user to access the WordPress Dashboard.

The ["Upload Files" capability](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#upload_files) is necessary to upload CSV files into WordPress.
