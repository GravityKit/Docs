# Naming Your Field Columns

When importing your file, GravityImport can auto-map headers to fields with the same label (using the "Map Exact Matches" button).

Some fields with multiple inputs have different field naming conventions. The defaults are shown below. If you have changed the input names, you will need to use those custom input names instead.

- Name: `Name (Full)`, `Name (Prefix)`, `Name (First)`, `Name (Middle)`, `Name (Last)`, `Name (Suffix)`
- Address: `Address (Full)`, `Address (Street Address)`, `Address (Address Line 2)`, `Address (City)`, `Address (State / Province)`, `Address (ZIP / Postal Code)`, `Address (Country)`
- **(Not yet supported)**Product Field: `Product Field (Name)`, `Product Field (Price)`, `Product Field (Quantity)`
