# “Row #1 ID does not exist for form” error

If you see this error, it means that the "Entry ID" column has been mapped, but there are no entries on the site that have the same ID as shown in the CSV.

When "Entry ID" is mapped, then the plugin looks to update an entry instead of creating one.

### How to resolve the error:

Return to Field Mapping, click the "x" icon next to the Entry ID column label, and try the import again.
