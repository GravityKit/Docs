# Import Step: Upload CSV

### Choose the CSV from your computer that you will import as Gravity Forms entries.

The Entry Importer plugin will try to auto-detect the data types in the file. In the next step, you will be able to preview the data and assign which form fields should be assigned to which columns in the data.

The Entry Importer only supports CSV ("Comma-Separated Values") files. If you have data in another format, you may be interested in the related articles linked to below.
