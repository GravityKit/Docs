# How to restrict access to Import Entries

![Screenshot of the Import/Export page of Gravity Forms](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/63757a51fd962f4d057bb251/file-aVN46EmSnP.png)

It's easy to give access to a custom user role to import entries [by adding some capabilities](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/825-capabilities-necessary-to-import-entries) to that role. But if you want to restrict access to the Import Entries tab in the Import/Export page of Gravity Forms, then you'll need to use the code snippet below.

```php
/**
* Remove the ability of a user to import entries based on their role.
*
* @param array $caps Array of capabilities required to display the UI.
*
* @return array
*/
add_filter( 'gravityview/import/capabilities', function ( $caps ) {

   // REPLACE THIS with the role you want to exclude from importing entries.
   $role = 'editor';

   $user = wp_get_current_user();

   if ( ! $user || ! $user->exists() ) {
       return [];
   }

   if ( in_array( $role, $user->roles, true ) ) {
       return [];
   }

   return $caps;
} );
```
