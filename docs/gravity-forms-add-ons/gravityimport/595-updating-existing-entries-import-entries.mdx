# Updating existing entries with the GravityImport plugin

In addition to creating new entries, the [GravityImport plugin](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravity-forms-entry-importer/) does allow you to update existing entries.


:::caution

**Beware**! When updating an entry, **the existing entry will be entirely overwritten**, not only the mapped fields. You **can't** use GravityImport to update only one field on your form.

:::

  If adding new entries and deleting old ones is not an option, please make sure you have a backup of your entries before proceeding. You can export your entries via Forms &gt; Import/Export &gt; Export Entries.

Here's how you can update existing entries with the Import Entries plugin:

### 1. Go to the Gravity Forms Import/Export page

Click on Import Entries

![Opening the Gravity Forms Import/Export page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5db09b4304286364bc90cb60/file-cs8IjtHW7C.png)

### 2. Upload the CSV file with your entries

Your CSV file must contain an Entry ID column to update existing entries.

### 3. Choose a form

### 4. Click the Continue button

Because your file will contain an Entry ID column, you'll get a warning that your entries will be overwritten. Click the blue Continue button to proceed.

### 5. Map columns from your file to the appropriate Gravity Forms fields

To update existing entries, your file must contain valid Entry IDs. **Please be aware that updating entries completely overwrites the existing entry.**

Click the "Continue with Import" button to proceed.

### 6. Configure the import settings

Once you have mapped your fields, there are some basic options to configure. If you aren't sure what to do, you can hover over a question mark, and it will have additional information on what the setting does.

![The Configure Import Options screen](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5db09fb404286364bc90cbac/file-8OTEnK6FkO.png)

Click the "Continue with Import" button to proceed.

### 8. Upon completion, the Import Results page will summarize the results

Successful update:

Unsuccessful update:

If there were errors, you can click the "view log" link to see a list of entries that were not updated and the reason they were rejected. You can also download a file containing the rejected records, fix the errors, then try your update again.

You'll see the following options as well:

- The View Imported Records button will appear if some of your entries were updated successfully. It will not appear if no entries were processed successfully.
- The Modify Import Configuration button will take you back to the Configure Import Options screen
- The Change Field Mapping button will return you to the Field Mapping screen, where you can make changes to your mappings
- The Start New Import will take you back to the Select Source screen
