# Adding a Print button to the Single Entry page

Sometimes we want to add a Print button/link to our Single Entry page to allow our users to print/download the contents of that page.

You can achieve this with the help of the [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field).

Just add a Custom Content field to the widget zone of your View with the code below:

```
<a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="window.print()">Print</a>
```
