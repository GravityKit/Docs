# Activating your license

After [Installing GravityView](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/69-installing-gravityview), you'll need to activate your license. Here's how to do it in three simple steps.

## 1. Log in to your account and copy your license key

Go to the [GravityKit account page](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/) and log in with your account details. Next, from the "Your Licenses" tab of your account page, copy your license key by clicking on the button on the right to copy it to your clipboard.

## 2. Log in to your WordPress website and navigate to the GravityKit "Products &amp; Licenses" page

You can do this by hovering over "GravityKit" in the WordPress menu and clicking "Products &amp; Licenses".

## 3. Paste your license key into the box and click "Activate License"

After clicking "Activate License", you should see a message saying that your license key is valid and active. If you have any problems, check to see if your license key has expired. If it hasn't expired, but you're still seeing errors, [contact our support](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/).
