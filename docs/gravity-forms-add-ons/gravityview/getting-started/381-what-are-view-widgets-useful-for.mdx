# What are View widgets useful for?


 Widgets in Views are tools that enhance your entry listings by allowing you to filter, paginate or navigate more easily among your entries. Some of these widgets are built-into GravityView, others are part of GravityView add-ons, like the A-Z filters. They can be added to your Multiple Entries layout in two different places, above and below your entries listing:

This is how they look like when added to your View editor:

And this is how they show up in your front-end View:
