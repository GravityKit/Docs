# Creating an image gallery (displaying images in a grid)


:::caution

If, after following the tutorial below, you can't get the images to open on a lightbox, then please read here how to fix that: [Fix lightbox links not being added to images](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/518-lightbox-links-not-being-added).

:::



### Add a File Upload Field


:::info

(If your form already has a File Upload field, you can skip this step.)

:::

  <span style="color: rgb(70,70,70)"></span>In the Gravity Forms editor, click File Upload to add a File Upload field to your form.

![Screenshot of the Gravity Forms editor ](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/604ab1073f70ab34d9b9e631/file-9JFY82dyjV.png)

### Enable Multi-File Upload

Check the setting named "Enable Multi-File Upload" to allow uploading more than one image at a time. This will allow the images to be grouped into a gallery instead of shown one at a time.

### Edit the View you would like to add a gallery to

![The Edit link for a View in GravityView](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/edit-the-view-you-would-like-to-add-a-gallery-to.png)

### Click the gear icon on the Multiple File Uploads field

Choose the field you want to turn into a gallery.

### Set the Custom CSS Class to "gv-gallery"

Make sure to use gv-gallery without the quotes, like so:

### Check "Enable lightbox" in the View Settings box

If you don't enable the lightbox, the images will still look better, but the slideshow functionality will not work. See the bottom of this how-to for an example.

### Save or update the View

![The Update button](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/save-or-update-the-view.png)

### Edit (or create) an entry for the form and upload images to the field

You can add as many images as you like. Once uploaded, they will be displayed as a gallery.

### Before

Before: each image is displayed full-size and as a bullet list.

![Images displayed one after the other in a list](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/604ab06c207e3b1188e1b5c0/file-x9Ilj4cGc0.png)

### After

After: the image sizes are reduced and the images are displayed as a grid.

![Images displayed next to each other in a grid layout](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/604ab0433f70ab34d9b9e62e/file-ngewnPo5Tp.png)

### And clicking any gallery image will zoom in

You can then navigate between the images using the left and right arrows.
