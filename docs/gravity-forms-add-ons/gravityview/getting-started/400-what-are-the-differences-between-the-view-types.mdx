# Comparing GravityView’s View Types

Once you’ve [created a new View](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/735-getting-started-choosing-a-form-and-a-view-layout) and linked it to an existing form in Gravity Forms, the next step is to choose a View type.

Depending on your [license](https://www.gravitykit.com/pricing/), you’ll be able to choose from up to 5 different View types.

- The *GravityView* license includes the **Table** and **List** layouts
- The *GravityView + Extensions Bundle* license includes the Table, List, and DataTable layouts
- The *All Access* license includes all View layouts (**Table**, **List**, **DataTables**, **Maps**, and **DIY**)


:::caution

Note: If one of the View layouts isn’t showing up, even though you have the correct license, it may be because you haven’t installed the required plugin. For instructions on how to do this, see [Managing GravityView plugins from the Manage Add-Ons Screen](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/489-managing-extensions).

**Table View**: Displays your Gravity Forms data in a table layout. This view works well for dense data or data that is mostly numerical.

**List View**: The listing view displays form entries one on top of the other. This view is perfect for directories, and personal profiles.

**DataTables**: With advanced filtering options, [DataTables](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/) gives you full control over how your data is displayed on the front end. With DataTables you can also export your data in a variety of formats.

**Maps**: Using the [Maps](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/maps/) view you can display Gravity Form entries as a marker on Google Maps. The Maps Layout is best for business directories, store locators, and services directories.

**DIY Layout**: Built for web developers, designers, and anyone with basic knowledge of HTML/CSS, the [DIY layout](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/diy-layout/) gives you maximum flexibility by allowing you to design your very own view layout.
