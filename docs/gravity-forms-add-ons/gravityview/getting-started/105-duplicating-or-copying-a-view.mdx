# Duplicating or copying a View

The ability to duplicate a View is already included in Version 1.6 and higher of GravityView.

The feature can be accessed from inside the Edit View screen (the "Clone View" link on the image below):

...or from the Views listing page using the "Clone" link that shows up when hovering over a View name:

Note: Users must have the `copy_gravityviews` capability to copy a View. By default, this is enabled for Administrator and Editor roles. [Learn more about GravityView capabilities](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/311-gravityview-capabilities).

### If you are using the [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/) plugin:

If you cannot see the *<u>Clone</u>* link, make sure to enable the Views custom post type in the Permissions tab for this plugin's settings page (Settings menu &gt; Duplicate Post):

### What's the difference between clicking "Clone" and "New Draft"?

- Clicking "Clone" will duplicate the View, including its status. You will be taken back to the All Views screen, and you will see the new View in the list.
- Clicking "New Draft" will duplicate the View, set the status to Draft, and take you to the Edit View screen to edit the newly created View.
