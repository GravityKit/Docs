# Duplicating a Gravity Forms entry from the backend of your site


:::info

Note: This functionality requires GravityView 2.6.

:::



With GravityView installed and activated, go to your Gravity Forms Entries screen.

Hover over or navigate to the entry you wish to duplicate. Links will appear. Click the Duplicate link.

![Screenshot of the Entry row, with the action links appearing below. The Duplicate link is circled in green.](https://i.gravitykit.com/M8npLT+)

### Note: The entry is not *exactly* the same

The entry field data will be the same, but the entry "meta data" will differ. When you click Duplicate, a new entry will be created with the **same submitted form data** as the original entry, but some details will change:

- `date_created` The date\_created will be set to the time the entry was duplicated
- `is_starred` Whether the entry is starred or not will be reset
- `is_read` The duplicated entry will be marked as unread, regardless of the original entry read status
- `source_url` will be updated to the current Gravity Forms entries screen URL
- `ip` The IP address of the current user (disabled if the form does not allow collecting IP Addresses)
- `user_agent` will be based on the current user
