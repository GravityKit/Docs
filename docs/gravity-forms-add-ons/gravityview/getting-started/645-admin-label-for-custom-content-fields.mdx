# Using an Admin Label for Custom Content fields

When creating or editing a View and using two or more Custom Content fields, it can be difficult to tell them apart from the default "Custom Content" admin label:

To remedy this issue, GravityView allows you to set an Admin Label, which is **only visible from the View editor** to users with the ability to add and edit Views.

To set an Admin Label for your Custom Content field, click the blue gear icon to the right of your Custom Content field:

On the Field Settings screen, enter your label in the **Admin Label** text box:

Once you set your Admin Label and click the Close button on the Options screen, you'll see your new label:

Frontend users will not see the Admin label.
