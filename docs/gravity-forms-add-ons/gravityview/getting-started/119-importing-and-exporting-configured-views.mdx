# Importing and Exporting configured Views

## Exporting Views

You can export GravityView Views just like you can export Posts in WordPress:

1. Sign in to your WordPress Admin
2. Click on Tools
3. Under Tools, click on Export
4. Select the Views radio button
5. Click the "Download Export File" button

This will generate an export file with all your Views stored in it. Note: the Gravity Forms entry data will not be exported, just your View configuration. [Learn how to download entry data from Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/exporting-form-entries/).

## Importing Views

1. Sign in to your WordPress Admin
2. Click on Tools
3. Under Tools, click on Import
4. Click "WordPress" 
   - If you don't have the WordPress Importer plugin installed, an install dialog will be shown to you. Click the "Install Now" button
   - After installing the plugin, click the "Activate Plugin &amp; Run Importer" link
5. Select the Views export file you wish to import
6. Click "Upload file and import"
