Now that your license is active, you can enjoy automatic updates!

If you ever have questions about the plugin, you can click on the blue circle with a question mark in the middle at the bottom of each GravityView page (we call that the "Support Port").

From there, you can also search our how-to articles and send support requests - all without leaving your website.
