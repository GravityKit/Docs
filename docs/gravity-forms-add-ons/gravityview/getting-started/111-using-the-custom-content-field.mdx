# Using the Custom Content Field



### 1. Click "Add Field"

###  2. Click on the Custom Content Field

### 3. Click on the Gear Icon

Clicking on the gear icon will bring up the Custom Content Field Settings. Here you'll see the Custom Content text editor where you can add plain text, HTML, shortcodes (including the \[gravityforms\] shortcode to embed a form!), or merge tags to your View.

### 4. Add Your Content Inside the Text Editor

In this example, we've added the {entry\_revision\_list} merge tag which is added to GravityView by the Entry Revisions add-on. The merge tag outputs a list of changes made to an entry over time.

**Note**: For a list of all the merge tags you can add to the Custom Content text editor, click on the button to the right (highlighted in red below).

#### Custom Content Example Output:

As you can see, the merge tag was replaced with a list of revisions made to the entry over time.

### 5. Save or Update your View

### Additional Code Examples

Lots of things are possible with the Custom Content field. Here are some more examples:

#### The {all\_fields} Merge Tag

The {all\_fields} merge tag allows you to display the entire submission as shown in the Gravity Forms View Entry screen.

![The Single Entry layout on the front end showing the entire form submission](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/60e6e40c61c60c534bd6d795/file-fKHm1mhQdB.png)

#### Custom HTML

Here's an example where we're using custom HTML to display a link.

#### The \[gravityforms\] Shortcode

Add a \[gravityforms\] shortcode to your Custom Content field to display a Gravity Form inside your View layout.
