The list includes our Extensions and Premium View layouts that enhance GravityView functionality, as well as stand-alone plugins that enhance Gravity Forms.

### Note: If you have a plan that does not include a plugin, you will see links to upgrade or purchase the plugin

When you upgrade to a different GravityView plan, **you will only pay the difference in price between the two plans.** If you have any questions about upgrading, [contact us!](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/)

### To install a plugin, click the Install button
