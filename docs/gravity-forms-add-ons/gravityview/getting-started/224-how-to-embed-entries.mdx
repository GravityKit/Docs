# Embedding Single Entries in a Post or Page

Sometimes you may find it useful to embed single entries into a post or page instead of an entire View.

### Prefer to Watch the Video?

When single entries are embedded in a page or post, they will be displayed according to how you configured the [Single Entry Layout](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/734-getting-started-adding-fields-to-the-multiple-entries-and-single-entry-pages).

Please also note that:

- Editing an embedded entry works as usual
- Multiple entries can be embedded in the same post or page

There are **three ways** to embed single entries into posts/pages:

1. Using the \[gventry\] shortcode
2. Copying and pasting the single entry URL
3. Using the "Add Media" button

We will run through each of these methods below.

## 1. Using the \[gventry\] Shortcode

The [\[gventry\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/463-gventry-shortcode) allows you to embed a single entry in a page, post, or custom content field.

The shortcode takes two parameters:

- entry\_id (The ID of the entry you want to embed)
- view\_id (The ID of the View that the entry is tied to)

Here’s what a completed shortcode looks like:

`[gventry entry_id="6" view_id="137"]`

### Locating the Entry ID

To get the ID for any given entry in Gravity Forms, log into your WordPress dashboard, hover over *Forms,* and click on *Forms*. Next, hover over your form and click on *Entries*. You should now see a list of all the entries for that form. Click on an entry. The entry ID will be displayed in a box on the right side of the page.

Hover over *Views* in your sidebar and click *All Views*. Select the View that contains the entry you want to embed. You can find the View ID inside the Embed Shortcode.

First, open your View on the front end and click on an entry to bring up its single entry page. If your entries don’t link through to a single entry, read: [Linking to a Single Entry](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/70-linking-to-a-single-entry).

To do this, click on *Posts (*or *pages)* and then *Add New*. Next, paste the URL you copied from the single entry page into the text editor.

If you’re using the [WordPress Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/), this will look similar to the screenshot below.

 **Note: The WordPress Block Editor will display a preview of the embed. The preview loads without styling, so it may look strange. But don’t worry; your entry will look normal on the front end.**

## 3. Adding Media

Instead of pasting the URL directly into your page editor, click the “Add Media” button and then click the link that says “Insert from URL”.

Paste the entry URL into the "Insert from URL" input field.

Finally, click "Insert into Post".
