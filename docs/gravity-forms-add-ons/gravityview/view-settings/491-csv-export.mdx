# View Settings: Allow Export: Exporting entries as CSV or TSV from GravityView



### In View Settings, click on the tab named "Permissions" and check the box named "Allow Export"

![Screenshot of the Permissions tab with an arrow pointing to the Allow Export option](https://i.gravitykit.com/znH09h+)

### To export all entries in a View (not just one page), check the "Show all in CSV" checkbox

![Arrow pointing to the setting](https://i.gravitykit.com/bakZxI+)

### Update the View

![The Update button](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/update-the-view.png)

### Go to the View

### To export the View as CSV, add "/csv/" to the end of the URL

The URL before: http://the-cupola.dev/view/guest-list/

The URL after: http://the-cupola.dev/view/guest-list/ **csv/**

### To export the View as TSV, add "/tsv/" to the end of the URL

The URL before: http://the-cupola.dev/view/guest-list/

The URL after: http://the-cupola.dev/view/guest-list/ **tsv/**

### When accessed, a file will be downloaded with the entries

![Web browser download icon](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/when-accessed-a-file-will-be-downloaded-with-the-entries.png)

The file's name will be the name of the View by default. Developers can modify the file name by [using this code](https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/2eceeac0a45ab992c798286304466ef8).

### Click "Add Widget" in the Multiple Entries Layout tab then click the widget named "Custom Content"

![A list of fields in GravityView with an arrow pointing to the Custom Content field](https://i.gravitykit.com/CnBc51+)

### Click the gear icon to edit the Custom Content widget settings

![An arrow pointing to the gear icon next to the field label](https://i.gravitykit.com/TgSqSm+) ![The Custom Content text editor containing an HTML anchor link](https://i.gravitykit.com/wcOnSS+)In this example, weâ€™re using the following HTML to add the /csv/ to the View URL.

```

<a href="http://the-cupola.dev/view/guest-list/csv/">Download as CSV</a>
				
```

We checked the box to "Automatically add paragraphs to content" to give the link more space.

### Save the View

![The Update button](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/save-the-view-1.png)

### Now the link appears in the View. Clicking it will download the entries as CSV.

### If the page shows Error 404 when trying to download a CSV file

- Go to your site's Dashboard
- Click on the Settings menu
- Click on the "Permalinks" link in the Settings menu
- Do not make any changes, just click the "Save Changes" button

You will only need to do this once, not when you configure a View.
