# Can I disable the Map It link?

![The Map It link that appears when displaying the Address field on a View](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5d828cac2c7d3a7e9ae1547d/file-8fDpiipEYK.png)

The `gform_disable_address_map_link` filter will prevent the "Map It" link from appearing when displaying the Address field on a View.

Documentation for this filter is available on the Gravity Forms website here: [gform\_disable\_address\_map\_link](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_disable_address_map_link/)
