# Displaying additional entries created by the same user

Sometimes it's helpful to see a list of entries created by the same user. GravityView includes a field you can use to do exactly that. To display additional entries created by the same entry creator:

### Edit Your View

In the View Configuration box, click the Add Field button, scroll down the list of available fields then click Other Entries:

### Save or Update Your View

### Displaying Other Entries Created by the Entry Creator

Once the Other Entries field has been added and the View has been saved, you'll see up to 10 entries created by the user:
