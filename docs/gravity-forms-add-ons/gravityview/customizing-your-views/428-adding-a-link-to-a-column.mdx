# Adding a link to a column

Sometimes, you collect a website URL or email address on your form, and instead of adding them to your View as another column, you want to use those fields to put a link in the name column, for example. For cases like that, we'll use the field Merge Tags inside a Custom Content field.

Let's start with our View:

Instead of adding the **website** column to the View, I want to use those URLs to create a link on the **name** column, so when you click on a name on the View, you are redirected to that website.

We will start by adding a Custom Content field to our View:

Then, we are going to add an HTML link to that **name** column using HTML tags:

And voil√°:
