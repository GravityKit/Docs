# Modifying the text displayed when there are no entries


:::info

New functionality: [Displaying a form if no entries exist on the View.](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/928-displaying-a-form-if-no-entries-exist-on-the-view)

:::

 
:::caution

The information provided in this article **doesn't work** with Views using the DataTables layout. If you are using a DataTables layout, please take a look at [this other article instead](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/200-how-to-customize-the-no-data-available-in-table-text).

:::



### GravityView defaults

By default, GravityView shows two values, depending on the situation.

If the View is displaying a search result, the default text is:

> This search returned no results.

Otherwise, if no search has been performed (the View is empty), the default text is:

> No entries match your request.

### Changing those texts

Since GravityView version 2.17, these two messages can now be modified directly in the View Settings metabox without the need of using custom filters:
