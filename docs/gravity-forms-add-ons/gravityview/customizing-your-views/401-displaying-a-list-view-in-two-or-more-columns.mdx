# Displaying a List View in a grid (two or more columns)

The GravityView List View Type allows you to display entries one after the other in a directory-style layout (in a single column). However, sometimes, you may wish to display entries in a grid-style layout using multiple columns. In this article, we'll show you how to create a View with multiple columns using the List layout.

Here's what the list layout looks like with a single column:

By adding some simple CSS styles, we can create a multi-column layout, like this:

It's simple to achieve this look because each listing is contained inside a DIV tag which uses the class `.gv-list-view`.

By adding some additional styles to that class and the View container, we can change the layout from single-column to multi-column.

```
.gv-list-multiple-container.gv-container {
   display:flex;
   flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.gv-list-multiple-container.gv-container .gv-list-view {
   margin-right: 10px;
   width: 250px;
}
```

The above CSS code will affect every List View on your site. To limit the changes to a specific View, replace `{viewID}` in the CSS below with the ID of the View you wish to modify:

```
.gv-list-multiple-container.gv-container-{viewID} {
   display:flex;
   flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.gv-list-multiple-container.gv-container-{viewID} .gv-list-view {
   margin-right: 10px;
   width: 250px;
}
```


:::caution

**Note**: To find the View ID, edit the View. Find the Embed Shortcode in the Publish box. The number displayed in the shortcode is the ID of the View.

:::

  To center the entries horizontally, add `justify-content: center` after `display: flex`. If you're unsure how to add custom CSS styles to your website, read: [How to add custom CSS to your website](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/246-adding-custom-css-to-your-website).
