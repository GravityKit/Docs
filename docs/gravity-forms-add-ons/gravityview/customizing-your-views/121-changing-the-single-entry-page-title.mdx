# Changing the Single Entry view title



### Choose a different single-entry title in the View settings

To define a different title for the single entry, edit your View. Scroll down to find the Settings box, click the Single Entry tab in the settings box, then set it to a different title.

### Or set it using the Merge Tags selector

Instead of setting up a fixed title for all the single entries page you could populate the field dynamically using the Merge Tags selector. By clicking on the small icon to the right of a text field (indicated by the blue arrow in the image below), you can insert content from the value of an entry.

For example, if we click on "Business Name", which inserts a "Merge Tag" that looks like `{Business Name:4}`. This will be replaced with the value from each entry. If you had three businesses: Google, Pizza Hut, and UPS. "`{Business Name:4}` Address" would be replaced with "Google Address" "Pizza Hut Address", and "UPS Address".
