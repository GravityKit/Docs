# How to change the View layout

If you created a View using one type of layout, for example, a Table View, and now you want to change its layout to a List View you can easily do that by clicking on the Switch View Type button:

...and then select your new layout from [the ones available](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/400-what-are-the-differences-between-the-view-types):

:::caution

Some layouts are not compatible! When switching from a Table View to a List View, all your fields configuration will be lost. Table View and DataTables are the only ones that won't require you to re-configure your fields when switching between them.
