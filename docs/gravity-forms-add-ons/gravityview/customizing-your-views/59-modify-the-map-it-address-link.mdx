# Modifying the "Map It" address link

**Available in GravityView 1.1.7 and higher.**

To modify the "Map It" link generated by GravityView, use the `gravityview_map_link` filter.

The filter is located inside the `gravityview_get_map_link()` function.

### The filter passes three arguments:

- `$link` - Existing anchor tag
- `$address` - Address to generate link for
- `$url` - The URL that was generated by GravityView. By default, a Google Maps link

Here's a simple code snippet to change the 'Map It' text to 'View on Google Maps':

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview_map_link', 'gv_change_map_it', 10, 5 );
function gv_change_map_it( $link, $address, $url  ){
	$link = str_replace('Map It','View on Google Maps',$link);
	return $link;
}
```
