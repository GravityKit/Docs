# Redirecting to a newly-created Gravity Forms entry



### Copy the URL of the View you want to redirect to

The URL is in the menu bar of your browser.

### Go to the Gravity Forms form Confirmations page

Edit the form connected to the View, then hover over Form Settings, then click Confirmations. Once there, click Edit under Default Confirmation.

You can also choose to create a new Confirmation by clicking the "Add New" button.

### Choose "Redirect" as the Confirmation Type

This will take users to another page after submitting the form.

### Set the Redirect URL

Paste the URL from your new View and add `/entry/{entry_id}/` to the end of the URL.

### Save the Confirmation

Save the confirmation, and you're all set: new submissions will be redirected immediately to their entry in the View.

### Are entries not visible? Make sure the "Show only approved entries" View Setting is unchecked

If your View only displays approved entries, the newly-created entries will not be available after submitting the form.
