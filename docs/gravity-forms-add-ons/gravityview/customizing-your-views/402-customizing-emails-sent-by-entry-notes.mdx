# Customizing emails sent by Entry notes

GravityView allows you to display, add, and delete entry notes from the front end of your website.

You can also email a copy of the recently-added note to another person:

Here's how that email (from the example above) will look:

Let's say we want to make the *note body* more noticeable. Let's wrap the body message with an [H2 tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp). Here's the code to do that:

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview/field/notes/email_content', 'gv_modify_notes_email_content', 10, 4 );

function gv_modify_notes_email_content( $email_settings ) {
   extract( $email_settings );
   $email_settings['message'] = '<h2>'.$message.'</h2>';
   return $email_settings;
}
```

Finally, here is how the emails will look after our little customization:

Neat, isn't it? Here are the other variables needed to modify all the other entry note email attributes:

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview/field/notes/email_content', 'gv_modify_notes_email_content', 10, 4 );

function gv_modify_notes_email_content( $email_settings ) {
   extract( $email_settings );
   $email_settings['from'] = $from; //example@gmail.com
   $email_settings['to'] = $to; //example@gmail.com
   $email_settings['bcc'] $bcc; //example@gmail.com 
   $email_settings['reply_to'] = $reply_to; //example@gmail.com
   $email_settings['subject'] = $subject; //subject of the email
   $email_settings['message'] = $message; //body of the email (already in HTML format)
   $email_settings['from_name'] = $from_name; //Example: GravityView Website
   $email_settings['message_format'] = $message_format; //html
   $email_settings['email_footer'] = $email_footer; //The text: This note was sent from {url}
   return $email_settings;
}
```
