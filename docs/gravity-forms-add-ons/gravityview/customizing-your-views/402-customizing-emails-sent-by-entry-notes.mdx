# Customizing emails sent by Entry notes

GravityView allows you to display, add, and delete entry notes from the front end of your website.

You can also email a copy of the recently-added note to another person:

Here's how that email (from the example above) will look:

Let's say we want to make the *note body* more noticeable. Let's wrap the body message with an [H2 tag](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hn.asp). Here's the code to do that:

Neat, isn't it? Here are the other variables needed to modify all the other entry note email attributes:
