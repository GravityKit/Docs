# Displaying video, audio, and media links as a player using the Custom Content field

Imagine you have a field in your form where people share a Vimeo or YouTube link, and you'd like to display those links as a Video player instead of the link to the video. Or you have a tweet from Twitter that you want to embed in a View.

By using the Custom Content field and enabling the "Render oEmbeds" field setting, you can embed video, audio, slideshows, documents, and other media from many services, including:

- YouTube
- Vimeo
- Twitter
- WordPress.tv
- [And many more!](https://wordpress.org/support/article/embeds/)

Here's how:

---

## 1. Add a Custom Content field to your View

Click the "Add View" button, then click the Custom Content field.
