# Overriding GravityView templates

## Overriding the page template

You can override the page template used to display GravityView Views by creating a `single-gravityview.php` template file. This is useful, for example, if you want GravityView Views to be displayed without sidebars, or without a menu bar.

GravityView Views are "Custom Post Types" with a slug of `gravityview`. You can override how your theme displays single GravityView Views by creating a `single-gravityview.php` template file. Duplicate the `post.php` or `page.php` file in your template directory, rename it `single-gravityview.php` , and start modifying!

[Learn more about WordPress template hierarchy](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/basics/template-hierarchy/).

## How to use your own template files

- In your theme, create a `/gravityview/` directory
- Find the template file you want to modify. They're located in the `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/plugins/gravityview/templates/` directory.
- Copy the file and its folder structure to your theme's `/gravityview/` directory.
- That file will now be used instead of the GravityView file!

The same applies to DIY layouts. The difference is that the reference DIY layout file is stored on `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/plugins/gravityview-diy/templates/` directory.

 #### Template override example:

You want to modify the `list-header.php` file. Instead of editing the GravityView plugin, you should copy the template file to your theme, so it doesn't get overwritten when GravityView is updated.

First, create a folder in your theme's directory like so:   
`[yoursite.com]/wp-content/themes/[yourtheme]/gravityview/templates/views/list/`

Then copy the file you wish to modify; in this case `list-header.php`

- **From** the GravityView directory: `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/plugins/gravityview/templates/views/list/list-header.php`
- **To** your theme's `gravityview` directory: `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/themes/[yourtheme]/gravityview/views/list/list-header.php` **<span style="color:#ff0000;">\*</span>**


:::danger

**<span style="color:#ff0000;">\* </span>**Notice that we are not using the `/templates/` folder inside your theme.

 #### The same goes for overriding field display

If you want to change how the Gravity Forms List field type is displayed

- **Copy from** the GravityView directory: `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/plugins/gravityview/templates/fields/field-list-html.php`
- **Paste to** the `/gravityview/fields/` sub-directory in your theme: `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/themes/[yourtheme]/gravityview/fields/field-list-html.php` **<span style="color:#ff0000;">\*</span>**


:::danger

**<span style="color:#ff0000;">\* </span>**Notice that we are not using the `/templates/` folder inside your theme.

 ## Template File Hierarchy

GravityView has the ability to override templates based on the View ID, the connected Gravity Forms Form ID, and the ID of the page that a View is embedded on (if using the shortcode).

- `view-[View ID]-table-footer.php`
- `form-[Form ID]-table-footer.php`
- `page-[ID of post or page where view is embedded]-table-footer.php`
- `table-footer.php`

For example, if you wanted to override the layout for the single entry view using the Table layout, you would use `table-single.php`.

If you want to override how it looks for a View with ID `46`, you would create a file named `view-46-table-single.php`. The final path would be `[yoursite.com]/wp-content/themes/[yourtheme]/gravityview/view-46-table-single.php`.

The same applies for widgets (using widget IDs) and fields (see "overriding field display" above). Want a different layout for your List fields? `view-46-single.php`
