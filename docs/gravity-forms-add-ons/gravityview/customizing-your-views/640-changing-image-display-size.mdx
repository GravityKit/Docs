# Changing the display size of images

You can change the display size of an image within a View with the `.gv-image` CSS class. For example, if you want your image to be resized to 300 pixels in height and width, you'll specify the height and width like so:

```css
.gv-image {
   width: 300px;
   height: 300px;
}
```

If you're not sure where to add custom CSS to your website, please see this article: [Adding custom CSS to your website](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/246-adding-custom-css-to-your-website)

If you need to resize an image to reduce the file size, the [GP Media Library](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-media-library/) plugin can help you do this.
