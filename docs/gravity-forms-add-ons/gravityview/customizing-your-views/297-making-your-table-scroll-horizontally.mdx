# Making your table scroll horizontally

If your table is too wide that it doesn't fit inside your theme's content area, you can choose to make it scroll horizontally.

Add the following styling code ("CSS") to your site ([learn how to add Custom CSS](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/246-adding-custom-css-to-your-website)):

```
.gv-table-container {
   overflow-x: scroll;
}
```

After you add the CSS, the table should scroll horizontally and stay within the bounds of your template!
