# What are the existing layout options to create a View?

Currently, GravityView has five types of layouts that you can use to create your View:

- Table View and List View (part of the Core license);
- DataTables (included in the GravityView + Extensions Bundle and All Access license levels)
- Maps and DIY (All Access license only)

You can see the layout differences here: [What are the differences between the View types](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/400-what-are-the-differences-between-the-view-types)
