# Adding a user's email address to Entry Notes

When viewing your Gravity Forms entries from the WordPress backend via **Forms &gt; Entries**, the Notes box displays the note author's email address:

By default, GravityView does not display the note author's email address when displaying the Entry Notes field on a View:

You can display the entry note author's email address with the following code:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jlgrisham/6a2d87e748e975267a6914c9c01f4604.js" type="text/javascript"></script> Adding the code above to your website will display the note author's email address next to their name like so:
