# Adding a user's email address to Entry Notes

When viewing your Gravity Forms entries from the WordPress backend via **Forms &gt; Entries**, the Notes box displays the note author's email address:

By default, GravityView does not display the note author's email address when displaying the Entry Notes field on a View:

You can display the entry note author's email address with the following code:

```
//CODE NOT FOUND: Please contact GravityKit's Support: https://www.gravitykit.com/support/
```

Adding the code above to your website will display the note author's email address next to their name like so:
