# Adding RTL (right-to-left) text support to a field

GravityView is already <abbr title="Right to Left">RTL</abbr> ("Right to Left") compatible; however, you might want to add this particular support to a particular field, so here's how to proceed.

Add the following <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> class to your theme:

```
.text-RTL,
.text-RTL * {
 direction: rtl!important;
 text-align: right!important;
}
```

Then, add this new CSS class to your field option's screen:

That's it!

##  How to add <abbr title="Left to Right">LTR</abbr> support to RTL website

Follow the instructions below, but use the following code instead:

```
.text-LTR,
.text-LTR * {
 direction: ltr!important;
 text-align: left!important;
}
```

And use `text-LTR` as the "Custom CSS Class" field value.
