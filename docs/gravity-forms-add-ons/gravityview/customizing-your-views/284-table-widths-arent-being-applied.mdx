# Table widths aren't being applied

If you add custom table column widths and the columns aren't willing to budge, add the following line of CSS to your site ([here's how](http://docs.gravityview.co/article/246-how-to-add-custom-css-to-your-website)):

```
table.gv-table-view {
 table-layout: fixed;
}
```

That will force the columns to respect your width settings.
