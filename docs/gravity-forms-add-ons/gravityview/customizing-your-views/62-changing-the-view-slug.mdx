# Changing the View slug

By default, the plugin presents Views using the following url structure:

```php

http://www.example.com/view/my-view-name/
```

If you'd like to change the part of the URL (known as a "slug") from `view` to a different name, then add the following code to your theme's functions.php:

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview_slug', 'my_gravityview_slug', 10, 1 );

function my_gravityview_slug( $slug ) {
   return 'my-new-slug'; // Set your new slug here
}
```

#### If the code doesn't work immediately:

After adding this to your theme, you may need to flush the rewrite rules.

To flush the rewrite rules:

1. Go to your site's WordPress Dashboard
2. Click on the Settings menu
3. Click on the Permalinks sub-menu link
4. Save the form settings on that page (without changing anything)
5. The rewrites should be updated, and the links should work!
