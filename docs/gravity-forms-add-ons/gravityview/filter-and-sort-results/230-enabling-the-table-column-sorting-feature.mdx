# Enabling the table column sorting feature

*This feature is available for GravityView 1.7+*

The table column sorting feature is the possibility to order the view entries by clicking on the column header sorting arrows. Clicking one time will sort the results ascending by default. If you click twice, it will sort descending.

This feature is only available on the default Table view type. The [DataTables](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/) table has the same feature by default, and so you won't need to configure it.

## Enable the columns sorting feature in your View

To enable the columns sorting feature, you'll need to open the View where you'd like to activate it, scroll down until you find the **Filter &amp; Sort** configuration metabox, and check the *Column Sorting* setting.

After saving the View, if you refresh your View in the front end you'll notice the arrows aside from the table column headers, as in the following example:
