# Making entries expire after a certain amount of time


:::caution


**This functionality requires the [Advanced Filter](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) Extension**, included in the *GravityView + Extensions Bundle* and All Access licenses.

:::



Most of the time, if you run a paid directory, you will want to make sure your entries "expire" after a certain amount of time (days, months or years), so you can charge your customers to renew their entries.

That is easily achievable by using the [Advanced Filtering extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) and [relative dates](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/79-using-relative-start-dates-and-end-dates). Relative dates are useful because you won't need to specify the amount of time manually every time.

In the example above, we'll stop displaying entries if our date field is older than 30 days. If our entry date is the 1st of January, that entry will show up until the 30th of January. On the 31st, it'll disappear from our list of results.
