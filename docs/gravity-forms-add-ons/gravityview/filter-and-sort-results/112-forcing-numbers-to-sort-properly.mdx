# Forcing numbers to sort properly

Let's say you have a drop-down field on your form with choices ranging from 1 to 10 or greater.

![Screenshot showing the options for a drop down field inside the form editor](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/635073918a552811521e6b1a/file-4Eu7yXGKwR.png)

And you try to sort your View by this field:

GravityView can't sort text-based fields as if they were numbers. So your View will probably appear like this, with the Order column not correctly sorted.

There's a way to force GravityView to interpret those fields as if they were numbers by using a special filter:

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview_search_criteria', 'gravityview_force_numeric_sort', 10, 3 );
function gravityview_force_numeric_sort( $criteria, $form_ids = array(), $context_view_id = 0 ) {
	$criteria['sorting']['is_numeric'] = true;
	return $criteria;
}
```

  This will force the View to sort these choices as if they were numbers:

This filter doesn't work for sorting a secondary field, unfortunately.
