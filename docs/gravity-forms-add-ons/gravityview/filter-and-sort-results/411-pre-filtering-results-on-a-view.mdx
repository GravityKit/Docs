# Pre-filtering results on a View

There are two ways possible to pre-filter your View results:

## 1. By using the `search\_field` and `search\_value` parameters from the \[gravityview\] shortcode

**Pros:** Ability to change the value used to filter results just by changing the `search_value` parameter. This way, you will need to create only one View configuration without filters that you can embed on multiple pages, using different filters.

**Cons:** You can only filter by one value at a time. To filter by multiple values, you will need to use the [Advanced Filter](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) extension (see below).

To learn more about how to pre-filter results using these two parameters ( `search_field` and `search_value`), check out this article:  
[Using the \[gravityview\] Shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/73-using-the-shortcode)

Here's an advanced tip: if you want to programmatically change the `search_value` parameter based on the page the View is embedded on using a variable, you can call the `[gravityview]` shortcode directly on the PHP template of your page.

Example:

```
echo do_shortcode('[gravityview id="12" search_field="3" search_value="'.$value.'"]');
```


:::caution

The PHP method explained above doesn't work with DataTables layouts.

 ## 2. By using the Advanced Filters extension 

If you have our [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) installed, you'll see this new section on your View Settings metabox:  
![Screenshot of Advanced Filter extension filters filtering by logged-in status and the first name of a field.](https://i.gravitykit.com/PTTGYQ+)You can configure multiple filters to specify precisely the entries you want to be displayed.

**Pro**: You can specify several different rules to narrow down your results.

**Cons**: The rules will <g style="font-size: 14px;">apply </g>to the entire View, so if you need to filter by different conditions, you'll need to create other Views for each purpose.
