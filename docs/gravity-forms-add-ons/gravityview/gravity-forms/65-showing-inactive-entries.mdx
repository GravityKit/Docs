# Showing inactive Entries

Gravity Forms has different entry statuses, like when an entry is in the trash. By default, GravityView **only displays active entries** (not spam or in the trash).

![Screenshot of the Entries page of Gravity Forms](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/634731bc62a58869ee5f113f/file-DIJmmkFrm0.png)

The `gravityview_status` filter allows you to choose to show entries that are not active.

The filter passes two arguments:

- `$status` string "active" "spam" or "trash" (default: active)
- `$args` array The parameters for the View, such as form ID, page size, sort direction, and field, etc.
