# Changing the creator of an entry in Gravity Forms

Sometimes you may want to change who created an entry or assign the entry to someone else. Here's how to do it in Gravity Forms.

First, hover over *Forms* and click *Forms*. Now, hover over the form containing the entry you want to modify and click on the link that says *Entries*.

Once on the *Entries* page, scroll down to the entry you want to modify or search for it in the search bar. When you've found it, hover over it and click *Edit*. Now, on the right side of the screen, you'll see a dropdown menu allowing you to update the entry creator.

When you've updated the entry creator, click *Update*.
