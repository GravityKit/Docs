# Creating a review/voting system by embedding a form into a single entry

Because GravityKit's [Ratings &amp; Reviews extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/ratings-reviews/) is based on the WordPress comments system, it is limited in some ways. For example, you can't export the reviews, or you can't generate a chart based on the votes. There are numerous other limitations besides these two ones.

In this tutorial, we'll provide a workaround to these limitations by using an embedded form inside a View's Single Entry page. We will create a new form to collect these ratings (or votes) and a new View to display them.

## What we'll need:

- The main View, in this case, is a simple Movie Catalog;
- A very simple form to collect movie reviews (Review this Movie);
- A View to display those reviews (Movie Reviews). This View will use the Review This Movie form as the data source.

Our Review This Movie form:

## How are we going to do it:

1. We'll start by adding a [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) to the Single Entry page of the Movie Catalog View;
2. The entry id of each movie will be used as a way to associate it with the reviews;
3. Inside our Review This Movie form, we'll have a hidden field that will collect the current entry id of the Movie in question;
4. Embed the movie reviews form into that Custom Content field using the \[gravityform\] shortcode;
5. Pass the current entry id to that form's shortcode by using [Dynamic Population](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-dynamic-population/); The entry id of the Moview can be pulled by using the {entry\_id} Merge Tag;
6. Embed the movie reviews View below that form above using the [\[gravityview\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/73-using-the-shortcode);
7. Filter that View to only display reviews with the same entry id of the current Movie using the [search\_field and search\_value parameters](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/73-using-the-shortcode).

In this example, the Movie Catalog View uses the List View layout, which has the perfect place to embed the form and View for our tutorial:

![Screenshot of the form editor showing the hidden field with dynamic population enabled](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/6328dba0894a5358bdd77a0c/file-GfrsxaANS5.png)

![Screenshot of the Custom Content field showing the [gravityform] shortcode being used with dynamica population](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/6328dd57e5ea7f482dc3ccb7/file-bPHyoMpXZt.png)

![Screenshot of the custom content field with the [gravityview] and [gravityform] shortcode](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/6323a3a793c4267ac207c1b2/file-IG56eTgKDn.png)

And here's what all of that looks like:

## Bonus!

For the star rating on the form, we used the Rating type from the [Survey field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/survey/) (only available in the [Elite license of Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/elite-license-plan/)), but to achieve that similar look on the View, we had to use the [\[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) and [dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/#admin-site-alt3).

Here's the code we used:

```
[gvlogic if="{Your Rating:3:value}" is="Terrible"]
<span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span>
[/gvlogic][gvlogic if="{Your Rating:3:value}" is="Not so great"]
<span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span>
[/gvlogic][gvlogic if="{Your Rating:3:value}" is="Neutral"]
<span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span>
[/gvlogic][gvlogic if="{Your Rating:3:value}" is="Pretty good"]
<span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span>
[/gvlogic][gvlogic if="{Your Rating:3:value}" is="Excellent"]
<span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span><span class="dashicons dashicons-star-filled"></span>
[/gvlogic]
```

When using the logic above, please replace `{Your Rating:3:value}` with the proper Merge Tag of your rating field.

The following CSS style was necessary to paint the stars gold:

```
.dashicons-star-filled{
   color: gold;
}
```
