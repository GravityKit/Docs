# Adding a Link to the Stripe Customer Portal in GravityView

If you use the [Gravity Forms Stripe add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/stripe/) to take payments on your site, you can add a link to the Stripe Customer Portal inside your Views. Clicking on the link will allow users to view their billing history and manage their subscriptions.

If you’re new to the Gravity Forms Stripe Add-On, read this [helpful guide](https://www.gravityforms.com/blog/how-to-take-subscriptions-with-stripe/) to get set up.

:::

 ## Configure Your Stripe Customer Portal

Start by logging in to your Stripe [account](https://dashboard.stripe.com/login) and configuring the Stripe Customer Portal. To do this, open the *Settings* page by clicking on the gear icon in the top right. Next, click on *Billing* under *Product settings.*

![The Settings screen in Stripe](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/62569f525d0b9565e1733583/file-tynW9L3nr0.jpg)

Now you can configure your customer portal by choosing which functions to provide your customers.

When you’re done, save your changes.

## Add the Stripe Customer Portal Shortcode to Your View

The next step is to add the Gravity Forms Stripe Customer Portal shortcode to your View layout. Start by clicking on the *Add Field* button and add a new Custom Content field to your View.

```
[gravityforms action="stripe_customer_portal_link"]
```

When you're done, update your View!

When customers click on the link, they can see their billing history and manage their subscriptions via the Stripe Customer Portal.
