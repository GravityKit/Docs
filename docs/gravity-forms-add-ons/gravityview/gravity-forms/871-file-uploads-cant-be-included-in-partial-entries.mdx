# File Uploads can't be included in partial entries

If you are using the [Partial Entries add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/partial-entries/) from Gravity Forms on your form, files uploaded to a partial entry won't be saved, even when using GravityView to edit partial entries.

If your form contains a File Upload field, you can see this warning on the Form Settings page:
