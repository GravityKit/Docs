# Is it possible to do date comparison with [gvlogic]?

Yes, date comparison with `[gvlogic]` is possible since GravityView version 2.15.

You can read more about that here: [Date Comparison Examples](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode#date-context-examples)

If you prefer an alternative without having to write shortcodes, you can now use [Field Conditional Logic](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/753-field-conditional-logic), which is a feature from the Advanced Filter extension (since version 2.1).
