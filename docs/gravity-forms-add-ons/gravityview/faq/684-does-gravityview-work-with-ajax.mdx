# Does GravityView work with Ajax?

The only View layout that supports the dynamic loading of entries via Ajax is our DataTables extension. You can find more info about it here: [https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/)

Don't forget to also check our demo website to understand how DataTables loads results with Ajax: [https://site.try.gravitykit.com/business-database/](https://site.try.gravitykit.com/business-database/)
