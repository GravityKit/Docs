# Does GravityView work with workflows made by Gravity Flow

If you looking for a way to replace your workflow inbox with GravityView, it'll depend. GravityView doesn't have all the functionalities available in the native workflow inbox made by Gravity Flow.

We always recommend our users talk to our [Gravity Flow](https://gravityflow.io/) friends first to make sure GravityView will integrate nicely with their Gravity Flow projects.
