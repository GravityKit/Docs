# Can GravityMath be used inside a Gravity Forms form?

Our GravityMath plugin adds a shortcode to WordPress that allows you to perform advanced calculations on your website using Gravity Forms data. However, this shortcode CANNOT be used inside a form. The shortcodes only works with data from existing entries.

The `[gravitymath]` shortcode **can only be used** on a WordPress post/page, or inside [GravityView's Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field).

The `[gravitymath]` shortcode **cannot be used** inside a [calculation formula](https://docs.gravityforms.com/using-calculations/), inside an HTML field, or anywhere else inside a form.

If you need the ability to perform advanced calculations inside forms, we recommend checking out [Advanced Calculations by Gravity Wiz](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-advanced-calculations/).
