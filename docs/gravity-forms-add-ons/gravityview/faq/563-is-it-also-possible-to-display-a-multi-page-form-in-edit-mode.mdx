# Is it possible to display a multi-page form in Edit Entry mode?


:::caution

This functionality is currently in testing and may have bugs. If you encounter any issues while running this code, please let us know!

:::



By default, Edit Entry doesn't support multi-page forms; we are currently developing support for this functionality.

If you would like to enable support, add the following code to your site ( [here's how to add the code](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)):

```php
add_filter( 'gravityview/features/paged-edit', '__return_true' );
```

When enabled, there are some [differences in behavior that you should be aware of](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/819-edit-entry-multi-page-forms).
