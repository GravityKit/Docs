# Which Post Fields are editable?

You can allow users to edit post content from the Edit Entry screen. Most Post Fields are editable, but some are not.

### Editable Post Fields:

- Post Title
- Post Content *(supports editing content using the rich text editor)*
- Post Excerpt
- Post Categories
- Post Custom Fields (see exceptions below)
- Post Tags
- Post Image

### Some Post Fields are not currently editable:

- Post Custom Field when the field is configured as a List or File Upload input

## Custom Post Type support

GravityView can also be used to modify Custom Post Types. The same rules above are applied to CPT fields.

Only CPTs created with this plugin are editable at this moment: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-custom-post-types/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-custom-post-types/)

CPTs created with the [Advanced Post Creation add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/advanced-post-creation/) can't be editable with GravityView yet, unfortunately.
