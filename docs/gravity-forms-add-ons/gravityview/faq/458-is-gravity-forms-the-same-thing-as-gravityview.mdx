# Is Gravity Forms the same thing as GravityView?

**[Gravity Forms](https://www.gravityforms.com/?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=Katz%20Web%20Services%2C%20Inc.&partner_id=1210629&irgwc=1&utm_campaign=1210629) and GravityKit are separate companies.** Gravity Forms is developed by [Rocketgenius](http://www.rocketgenius.com) and GravityView and other GravityKit add-ons are developed by [Katz Web Services, Inc.](http://www.katzwebservices.com)

*GravityView* (one of our plugins) displays form submissions from *Gravity Forms*. Although we can offer some assistance with Gravity Forms issues (if they pertain to our add-ons) we, unfortunately, cannot help with general sales inquiries or support issues.

###  Gravity Forms is Required to Use GravityView

Note that GravityView is dependent on Gravity Forms. If you don't have Gravity Forms installed on your website, you will not be able to use GravityView.
