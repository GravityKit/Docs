# GravityView updates aren't displaying



### 1. Reason 1: Your website doesn't know it exists yet.

Your website only checks for plugin updates every few hours. You can force it to check again. To do this:

#### 1.1 Go to the "Updates" page in the WordPress Dashboard.

In the WordPress Dashboard, go click on "Updates*."*

#### 1.2 If you don't see GravityView in the plugin list, click the "Check Again" button.

#### 1.3 If you still don't see a GravityView update available, continue to the steps below.

### 2. Reason 2: Your license is inactive.

When you purchased GravityView, you should have received your license key, which enables GravityView to auto-update. If you haven't entered your license key, you won't be notified of updates.

#### 2.1 You have moved your site to a new domain.

If you activated your license for a staging or development website, make sure you re-activate it for the production domain. If you don't, updates won't be visible, even though the plugin license will appear to be valid.

#### 2.2 If your license is invalid, you will see the message "Not Valid".

There are a few reasons your license may be invalid:

- You have entered the wrong license key (please re-enter and try again)
- If you are using Version 1.1.5 or lower, make sure you have the "No-Conflict Mode" setting turned off when trying to activate the license. Versions 1.1.6 and higher don't have this issue.
- You have reached the limit on activations for your license. *Core* and *GravityView + Extensions Bundle* licenses are valid for five sites and *All Access* for 100. This may be because you have activated the plugin on a development site and live site. If that's the case, please contact us, and we'll sort it out for you. You can also upgrade your license on the [GravityKit Account page.](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/)

#### 2.3 If your license is valid, you will see "Status: Valid".

The plugin should be receiving updates.

### 3. Reason 3: You're running a version with broken updates.

Some versions of GravityView had issues with automatic updates. You will need to re-download the plugin if you're running one of these versions. Here's a list of GravityView releases with broken automatic updates:

- Version 1.1
- Version 1.3

On the GravityView Settings page, if you see the version number under the word GravityView (like in the image below), you're running a version with broken auto-updates.

#### 3.1 Running a version with broken auto-updates?

Log into your [GravityKit Account page](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/) and scroll down to "Download History." Click on the "GravityView" link under Files. This will download the newest version of the plugin. From there, [follow the instructions to install the plugin](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/69-installing-gravityview).
