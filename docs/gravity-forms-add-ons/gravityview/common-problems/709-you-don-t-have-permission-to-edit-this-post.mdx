# You don’t have permission to edit this post.

If you see the *You don’t have permission to edit this post.* error message on GravityView's edit entry page, it means you are using [Post Fields](https://gravitywiz.com/use-gravity-forms-to-create-user-submitted-posts/) on your form, and you are currently logged in with an account that doesn't have [Post Editing capabilities](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#author).

Whenever you use a Post Field on your form, a WordPress Post will be created during form submission. However, most of the time, the currently logged-in user that is submitting the form on your website has a [Subscriber role](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/) which doesn't allow them to edit these Posts later, hence the error message.

Only use Post Fields if you truly need their functionality. The most common mistake is using a **Post Image** field to upload documents on your form. Instead, please use the **File Upload** field for this job.
