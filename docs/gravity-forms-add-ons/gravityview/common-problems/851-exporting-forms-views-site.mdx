# Exporting forms & Views from your site

## Follow the instructions below to back up the forms and Views on your website.

### Forms

If you’ve created forms in Gravity Forms that you want to save, you can download these as a JSON file, which you can then import to another website running Gravity Forms. To do this, hover over Forms and click Import/Export. Now click on the tab that says “Export Forms”. Next, select the forms you want to export and click Download Export File.

### Pages, Posts and Views

WordPress has a built-in export feature that allows you to back up your website content (including posts, pages, comments, custom fields, terms, navigation menus, and custom posts). Your content will be exported as an XML file, which you can then import into another WordPress website.

Hover over Tools and click Export. Now choose what to export (or select “All content” to export everything) and click Download Export File.
