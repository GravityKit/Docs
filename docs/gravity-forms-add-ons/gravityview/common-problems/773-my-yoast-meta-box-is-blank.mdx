# My Yoast Meta Box is blank

If you're using our [Social Sharing &amp; SEO](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/social-sharing-seo/) extension to [set up SEO for your View](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/725-setting-up-seo-for-views-with-yoast-seo), but the Yoast SEO Meta Box looks like this:

This is a known issue with a previous release of our Social Sharing &amp; SEO extension, or there might be a conflict with your theme or another plugin.

Here's how to solve it:

1. Make sure you are running the latest version of Yoast, GravityView, and our Social Sharing SEO extension.
2. If that doesn't already solve it, try deactivating our [No-Conflict Mode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/226-enabling-no-conflict-mode) on the GravityView settings page.

  
That should do it!
