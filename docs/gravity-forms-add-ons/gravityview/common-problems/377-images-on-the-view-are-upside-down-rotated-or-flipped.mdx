# Images on the View are upside down, rotated or flipped

That's a problem with an image metadata called [EXIF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif).

When this image was uploaded to your WordPress (or a Gravity Forms form), this EXIF metadata wasn't properly transferred or was even stripped down during the upload process.
