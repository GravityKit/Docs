# Add Field or Add Widget buttons aren't working

This is likely a theme or plugin conflict.

#### To fix the issue, turn on No-Conflict Mode:

1. Go to GravityView settings ( Views &gt; Settings )
2. Click the "On" button for the "No-Conflict Mode" setting (see screenshot below)
3. Click "Save Changes" button

Once you update the setting, return to the Edit View page, and it should work properly.
