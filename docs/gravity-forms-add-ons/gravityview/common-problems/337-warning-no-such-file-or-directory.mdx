# During installation: "Warning: No such file or directory"

Some hosts have aggressive anti-virus scanners, which block a file from being installed because it has code called "check\_wordpress" in it. What happens is that the file containing that text gets deleted as soon as it's uploaded, causing GravityView to error.

The error looks like this:

```
Warning: require_once(/[...]/wp-content/plugins/gravityview/includes/class-gravityview-compatibility.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /[...]/wp-content/plugins/gravityview/gravityview.php on line 71
```

### To fix the problem, contact your host

Contact your web host and ask them to "Whitelist the /wp-content/plugins/gravityview/includes/class-gravityview-compatibility.php file". Once they do, this issue will be fixed.
