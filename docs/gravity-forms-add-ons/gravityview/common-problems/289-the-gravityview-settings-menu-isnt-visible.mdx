# The GravityView settings menu isn't visible

Since version 1.7.4 GravityView settings is using the Gravity Forms add-on settings capability to enable the screen. Since then, only users with the WordPress capability *manage\_options* are able to access the GravityView settings screen.

If you are not sure if you have the right capabilities on your users' role we suggest you install a plugin like [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/), check under Users &gt; Roles.

**If you still don't see the Settings menu under Views, continue to read...**

On some WordPress installations we found out there is also the need to have a Gravity Forms capability *gform\_full\_access* in order to be able to see the Settings menu.

To add it to your users' role, go to Users &gt; Roles, edit your role, and at the bottom click on "Add New Capability":
