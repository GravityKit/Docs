# "Cheatin' Uh?" message is displayed when editing a View

### This error is caused by plugin conflicts.

Here's how to identify the conflicting plugin:

- Disable all plugins, except for Gravity Forms and GravityView
- Re-enable plugins one at a time, checking to see if editing a View works
- When you find the plugin that causes the issue, please [let us know](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/)
