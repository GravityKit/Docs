# Why is my View slow to load?

We have found two leading causes that can impact View loading times on the front end:

### Encryption Plugins

Encryption plugins like [Gravity Forms Encrypted Fields](https://codecanyon.net/item/gravity-forms-encrypted-fields/18564931) or similar plugins can significantly impact View loading times.

Encrypting and decrypting values are very slow tasks (on purpose!). This doesn't pair well with fast load times on the front end.

### Gravity Forms Secure File Download Location

Gravity Forms hides the true path (location) of uploaded files for security purposes. This makes sense; however, this is known to severely impact View loading times, especially if your View displays lots of images.

The path for secure file locations contains the `?gf-download` parameter on the URL, like this:

`	https://www.example.com/index.php?gf-download=2018%2F11%2F864260e1-b0af-4f61-b798-b6ff0b1d49931.jpg&form-id=1&field-id=4&hash=409bda81bdd179545da1512e9e06ab1753104582a52bedeeaac04f8366e2c264	`

Insecure file locations, on the other hand, will load files directly from their path, like this:

`	https://www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity_forms/864260e1-b0af-4f61-b798-b6ff0b1d49931/2018/11/name-of-the-file.jpg	`

...which will greatly improve image loading times.


:::info

Note how the secure link doesn't show the file's name, but the insecure link does.

:::

  Adding the code below will direct GravityView to use the insecure path to the image when displaying it.

```php
add_filter( 'gform_secure_file_download_location', '__return_false' );
```

If you want to make the file URLs visible for only one form, you can use this code instead (replacing `FORM_ID` with the form ID.)

```php
add_filter( 'gform_secure_file_download_location_FORM_ID', '__return_false' );
```

As with all our code samples, [here's how to add the code](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples) to your site.
