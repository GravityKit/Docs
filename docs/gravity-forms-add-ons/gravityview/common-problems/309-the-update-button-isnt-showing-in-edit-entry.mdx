# The "Update" button isn't showing in Edit Entry

If you can't see the Update button in the Edit Entry page of your View on the front end, it's probably because the " **Submit**" button on your form has the "**Submit Button Conditional Logic**" functionality activated:

![Screenshot of the form editor](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/63b7b17ad0b6de7e3be2a73a/file-u1fq38EMyx.png)

To restore the Update button, you will either need to:

- [Make sure that all the fields that are defined](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/367-conditional-logic-on-the-edit-entry-page) in "Submit Button Conditional Logic" are included in the Edit Entry tab on the View editor, or
- Deactivate the "Submit Button Conditional Logic" functionality the in the form editor.

Once you do that, the Update button will once again be visible!
