# My View widgets are not showing up on my Divi theme

If your theme uses Divi and your View widgets don't show when you embed the View on a page using the GravityView block or [\[gravityview\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/73-using-the-shortcode), a conflict is happening.

Divi has a setting called "Grab the first post image," which prevents GravityView widgets from displaying.

Add the function below to your theme's functions.php file to resolve that conflict:

```php

/** 
* Prevent Divi from using the "Grab the first post image" setting.
* 
* It uses et_first_image() which uses apply_filters( 'the_content' ) which causes
* a conflict GravityView, which uses 'the_content' filter.
* 
* @param bool $setting Is the setting enabled and the request is not Buddypress?
*
* @return bool If displaying a GravityView View, false. Otherwise, the original value.
*/
add_filter( 'et_grab_image_setting', function( $setting ) {
   if ( function_exists( 'gravityview' ) && gravityview()->request->is_view() ) { 
       return false;
   }
   
   return $setting;
} );
```
