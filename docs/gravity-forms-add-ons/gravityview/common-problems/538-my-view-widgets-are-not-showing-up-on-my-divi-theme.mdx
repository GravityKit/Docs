# My View widgets are not showing up on my Divi theme

If your theme uses Divi and your View widgets don't show when you embed the View on a page using the [\[gravityview\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/73-using-the-shortcode), a conflict is happening.

Divi has a setting called "Grab the first post image," which prevents GravityView widgets from displaying.

Add the function below to your theme's functions.php file to resolve that conflict:
