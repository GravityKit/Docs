# Price fields and numbers being sorted alphabetically, not numerically

When given $20,000, $2,000 and $20, Gravity Forms will sort the array like this: $2,000, $20, $20,000 because Gravity Forms is alphabetically sorting the numbers rather than sorting by value.

This is a known issue with Gravity Forms. We've reported the issue, and rocketgenius hope to include the fix in Gravity Forms Version 2.0.

We've come up with a fix that might help *sort* this issue out (sorry for the pun). Read the related article below for more information.
