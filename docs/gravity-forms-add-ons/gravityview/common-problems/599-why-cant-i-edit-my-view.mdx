# Why can't I edit my View?

You may not have the appropriate level of access to Edit a View, even though you can create a View. Additional [user capabilities](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/311-gravityview-capabilities) are required for users who are not in the Administrator or Editor roles to be able to edit a View.

Please check the following document for a more detailed explanation: [Creating a View Editor role](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/598-non-administrator-edit-view).
