# Problems loading images: Gravity Forms Secure File Download Location

Version 2.1.1 of Gravity Forms added security improvements that affect how GravityView loads images on a View.

GravityView supports [Gravity Forms' secure download locations](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_secure_file_download_location/), which hide where a file has been uploaded. This is good for security, but it can affect the View loading speed if your View contains multiple images.

Note how the secure link doesn't show the name of the file, but the insecure link does:

- **Secure:** https://www.example.com/index.php?gf-download=2018%2F11%2F864260e1-b0af-4f61-b798-b6ff0b1d49931.jpg&amp;form-id=1&amp;field-id=4&amp;hash=409bda81bdd179545da1512e9e06ab1753104582a52bedeeaac04f8366e2c264
- **Insecure:** https://www.example.com/wp-content/uploads/gravity\_forms/864260e1-b0af-4f61-b798-b6ff0b1d49931/2018/11/**name-of-your-file.jpg**

### How to disable the secure paths

Adding the code below will direct GravityView to use the insecure path to the image when displaying it.

```

add_filter( 'gform_secure_file_download_location', '__return_false' );
```
