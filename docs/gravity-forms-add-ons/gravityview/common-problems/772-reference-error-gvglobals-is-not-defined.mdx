# ReferenceError: gvGlobals is not defined

If for some reason you're experiencing this Javascript error message on your Browser's console, that probably means your theme is not calling the `wp_footer()` function on its footer.php file.

If that's the case, then you'll need to edit that file using the theme editor inside your WordPress website and add that function:

If your theme already has the call to the wp\_footer() function and you are still seeing that error message on the Browser console, then you must add this line of code before it:

`do_action('wp_print_footer_scripts');`

That will force your theme to properly print the Javascript code needed for GravityView to work properly.

Here's what it'll look like:
