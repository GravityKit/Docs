# WPML and GravityView



### Floaty has a View that he wants to translate

It's an international guest list, so he wants to provide it in multiple languages.

### First, ensure you have WPML Multilingual CMS installed and activated.

This requires the [Multilingual CMS](https://wpml.org/purchase/) WPML package.

### In the Dashboard, under the "WPML" menu, click on "Settings":

### Click on the "Multilingual Content Setup" tab and then on "Post Types Translation"

### Set the "Views" custom post types to "Translate"

This tells WPML you want to translate Views.

### In the Custom Field Translation settings, click the "Show system fields" link

The GravityView custom fields are hidden, so they don't show up without a fuss!

![Screenshot of the Custom Fields Translation section](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/6344a39005ba014734a39513/file-vVfGJpLtWv.png)

### Search for "\_gravityview" 

For every "Custom Field" item that starts with "\_gravityview," choose "Copy once."


:::caution

Note: If you don't see any GravityView custom fields yet, you may not have created any Views. Create a View first, then return here.

### Update Custom Content widgets and fields

### As well as field labels

### Once the View configuration is translated…

### …save the View, and check out how it looks!

### The translated View has translated labels and Custom Content widget

But the entry content is not translated; it remains the same.

### Let's check out the English version again…

### …and it's still the original translation.

Hey, look at that: you have a translated View!
