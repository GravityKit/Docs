# Only some users are visible the Change Entry Creator dropdown

Some larger websites have many users, so GravityView limits the number of users displayed in the Change Entry Creator dropdown by default. This was to prevent the page from taking too long to load in cases where there are thousands of users.

The default number of users shown is 2,000. If you have more, install the plugin below.

#### Download and install this plugin to remove the user limit: [gravityview-show-all-users.php.zip](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/attachments/55216cfee4b0221aadf25275/gravityview-show-all-users.php.zip)

### Advanced filtering of users

If you would like to modify the users that are shown in the Change Entry Creator dropdown, use the `gravityview_change_entry_creator_user_parameters` filter. It accepts all the arguments passed to the `get_users()` function ([see the Codex doc](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_users)).
