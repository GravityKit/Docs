# License is shown as invalid

There are a few reasons your license may be shown as invalid:

- **You may have moved domains**. Please go to Views &gt; Settings, and then Deactivate and re-activate your license. 9 out of 10 times, this fixes the issue.
- **You have entered the wrong license key** (please re-enter and try again)
- **You have reached the limit on activations for your license.** *Core* licenses and *GravityView + Extensions Bundle* licenses are valid for 5, and *All Access* for 100. This may be because you have activated the plugin on a development site and live site. If that's the case, please contact us, and we'll fix the issue for you. You can also upgrade your license on your [GravityKit Account page.](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/)
- You are still using the BETA\_TESTER key from when GravityView was in Beta. This is no longer valid.
- If you are using Version 1.1.5 or lower, make sure you have the "No-Conflict Mode" setting turned off when trying to activate the license. Versions 1.1.6 and higher don't have this issue.

**If you use Version 1.1**, please re-download the plugin from your [GravityKit Account](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/) page. Once you have updated the plugin, you will be able to receive plugin updates.
