# Strange display issues inside the View editor

If you spot something weird, like partially hidden texts and fields (see the image below), inside your GravityView's View editor page, don't worry! That's just our No-Conflict mode in action.

Those pieces of text and fields are just metaboxes from your theme or another plugin that were improperly loaded inside the View editor.

**They shouldn't be there in the first place.**

If you wish to "correct" that, go to GravityView's Settings page and disable the No-Conflict mode:

:::caution

Disabling the No-Conflict mode will allow your theme and other plugins to load any scripts and styles inside the View editor, which can also create a conflict with our View Editor scripts and styles and end up preventing you from working on your Views.
