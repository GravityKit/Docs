# My Entries Are Not Showing Up



###  How To Check Whether Your Form Has Any Entries 

First, hover over *Forms* and click on *Forms.*

Now hover over the name of you form and click on the *Entries* link.

If your form has entries, they will appear here.

**Note**: If you have "Show only approved entries" enabled, you will need to approve or reject entries from this page. For guidance, please [follow these instructions](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/88-approving-or-rejecting-entries-in-gravityview).

### Creating New Entries

To create entries for a form, you'll need to embed the form in a post or page or click on the "Preview" link to preview the form. In either case, filling in the required fields and submitting the form will create a new entry.
