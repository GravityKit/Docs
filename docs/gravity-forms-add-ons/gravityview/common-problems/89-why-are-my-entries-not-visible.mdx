# My Entries Are Not Showing Up



### 4. Field Conditional Logic is being used on all fields

[Field Conditional Logic](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/753-field-conditional-logic), a feature introduced in version 2.1 of the [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/), doesn't hide empty fields from showing up on your View; it just outputs a different value or leaves the value empty.

If your View is showing empty rows like this:

![A View showing empty rows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/641cd36ac50436764befded0/file-iLo6NfO9aj.png)

It means you are probably using the same Field Conditional logic on all fields (columns) added to your View.

Please consider using Advanced Filters to hide these empty entries instead.

###  How To Check Whether Your Form Has Any Entries 

First, hover over *Forms* and click on *Forms.*

Now hover over the name of you form and click on the *Entries* link.

If your form has entries, they will appear here.

**Note**: If you have "Show only approved entries" enabled, you will need to approve or reject entries from this page. For guidance, please [follow these instructions](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/88-approving-or-rejecting-entries-in-gravityview).

### Creating New Entries

To create entries for a form, you'll need to embed the form in a post or page or click on the "Preview" link to preview the form. In either case, filling in the required fields and submitting the form will create a new entry.
