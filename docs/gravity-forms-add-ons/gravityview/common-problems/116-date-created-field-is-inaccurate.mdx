# "Date Created" field is inaccurate

Gravity Forms stores entry creation dates in [Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time) by default.

GravityView displays the Date Created field using the blogâ€™s local timezone for calculating the entry's creation date. If your blog's timezone hasn't been set, your blog will default to using UTC. [Read how to set your blog's timezone](http://en.support.wordpress.com/settings/general-settings/#timezone).

If you prefer to display the UTC value instead of the timezone-adjusted value, use the `gravityview_date_created_adjust_timezone` filter like this:

```php
add_filter( 'gravityview_date_created_adjust_timezone', '__return_false' );
```

Not sure what to do with that code? [Here's how to add that code to your site](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples).
