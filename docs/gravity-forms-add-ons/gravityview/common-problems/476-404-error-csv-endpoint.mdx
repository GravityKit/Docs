# Getting a 404 error when accessing CSV endpoint

In Version 2.1, GravityView added the ability to export a CSV of View results.

The CSV can be accessed by adding "/csv/" to the end of the View URL.

- Before: [https://example.com/view/my-example-view/](https://example.com/view/my-example-view/)
- After: [https://example.com/view/my-example-view/](https://example.com/view/my-example-view/)**csv/**

If you are getting a 404 error when trying to access the CSV, there may be two reasons:

1. Permalinks need to be re-saved 
   1. Go to your Dashboard
   2. Click on the Settings menu item in the sidebar
   3. Click on "Permalinks"
   4. Click the "Save Changes" button to save the form
   5. Now the /csv/ URL should work!
2. **The View is embedded in a post or a page**  
   Follow these instructions to correctly link to the CSV file when a View is embedded on a page or post: [Exporting entries as CSV](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/491-csv-export)
