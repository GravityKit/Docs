# Creating a View Editor role


:::info

These instructions only work for GravityView version 2.16 or newer.

:::



### 1) Install and Activate the [Members plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/)

![Screenshot of the Installed Plugins page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fbece23a10d7e43619e87/file-iSSqUOJxGz.png)

### 2) Go to the Members menu &gt; Roles

### 3) Clone the Editor role

### 4) Rename the role name and add capabilities

Start by renaming the role to something easy to identify, like "View Editor."

Editing a View requires permissions that are normally only assigned to Administrators.

This is because Views allow users to display HTML, which is a capability that is restricted in WordPress. The required [unfiltered\_html](https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#unfiltered_html) is already included in the Editor role.

Here's a list of the capabilities necessary to be added to this role:

- edit\_others\_gravityviews
- edit\_private\_gravityviews
- edit\_published\_gravityviews
- gravityforms\_create\_form
- gravityforms\_delete\_forms
- gravityforms\_edit\_forms
- gravityforms\_view\_entries
- gravityforms\_edit\_entries
- gravityforms\_delete\_entries

GravityView-specific capabilities:

Also, when creating new Views, you can create a new Gravity Forms form directly from the View editor. These capabilities are required to create new forms when using the View editor.

### 5) Save your new Role

### 6) Add users to this role

Now you just need to go to the Users menu and assign the new View Editor role to your users.
