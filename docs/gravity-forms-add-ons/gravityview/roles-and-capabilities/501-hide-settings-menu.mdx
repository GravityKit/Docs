# (Outdated) How to hide GravityView Settings menu


:::danger

⚠️This article doesn't apply to GravityView version 2.16 (or newer).

:::



If you are developing a site for a client, you may not want to show them the Settings page, which contains license key information, renewal dates, support email address settings, and more.

### Recommended: remove the user permission

The recommended way to disable access to settings is by removing the user's permission by modifying their user role. [Here's a doc showing how to do that with the Members plugin](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/333-modifying-user-role-capabilities), but if you use another role manager plugin, it will also work. Remove the `gravityview_view_settings` capability from the user's role.

### This also works: adding code

If you want to disable the Settings menu for specific user IDs, take this code, update it to use the user IDs you want to limit access for, then [add this code to your functions.php:](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/02ff3642e468072f36aa85becc4b8c29.js" type="text/javascript"></script> If you want to disable the Settings menu for everyone, you can [add this code to your functions.php](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples):

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview/show-settings-menu', '__return_false' );
```

That will hide the menu for everyone, **including yourself!**
