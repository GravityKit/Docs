# Filtering entries by WordPress User Roles

If you want to display different entries for different user roles, we suggest you create one View for each user role and then use this shortcode from this fantastic plugin called [Members](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/):

```
[members_access role="editor"]Hide this content from everyone but editors.[/members_access]
```

Since you can specify the role, you can create a View for each.

Example:

```
[members_access role="subscriber"][gravityview id="12"][/members_access]
[members_access role="author"][gravityview id="13"][/members_access]
[members_access role="administrator"][gravityview id="14"][/members_access]
```

You can [read more about the usage of the \[members\_access\] shortcode](https://github.com/justintadlock/members/blob/master/readme.md#shortcodes).
