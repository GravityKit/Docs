### Click "Install Now" to install

Members should be the first result. If not, find it in the search results.

### Click on the GravityView group

You can see all the GravityView capabilities in one spot by clicking on the GravityView tab. You can also see the capabilities in "All" if you want.

### Check "Deny" for capabilities you wish to remove

**Make sure to check "Deny" for `gravityview_full_access`**. Users with the `gravityview_full_access` capability will automatically have **all** GravityView capabilities.

In this example, we want to prevent the user from seeing the GravityView Settings page, so we also uncheck `gravityview_view_settings` and `gravityview_edit_settings`.

### Click their username to edit the User

### At the bottom of their profile, select the new User Role

After checking the role checkbox, click "Update User".

### Now, if the user attempts to access the settings page…

They'll see this message—and won't see the settings screen.

### You can see all users with the new Role

Go to All Users, and you'll see the new role in the role filter list. Click the link to see all users with that role at once.
