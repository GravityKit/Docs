# Creating an Entry Moderator role



### 1) Install and Activate the [Members plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/members/)

![Screenshot of the Installed Plugins page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fbece23a10d7e43619e87/file-iSSqUOJxGz.png)

### 2) Click on "Roles" page under the Members menu

### 3) Click the "Add New" button next to Roles

###  ![Screenshot of the Members page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fbfa65af7a97b505052ca/file-BaznY8cnut.png)4) Give the new Role a name

![Screenshot of the new role creation page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fc0838ae44905ae2cc902/file-oNtXbwbuQG.png)Ensure that the most basic capability necessary to all roles, the read capability, is checked. 

In this example, we've named the role "Entry Moderator".

### 5) Add the necessary Gravity Forms capabilities

![Screenshot of the required Gravity Forms capabilities](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fc0dd23a10d7e43619e8a/file-lARbP69BSe.png)

There are a *lot* of capabilities to choose from. At the very least, you're going to want to allow the user to have the `gravityforms_view_entries`, `gravityforms_edit_entries`. If you want them also to be able to delete entries, you'll want to enable `gravityforms_delete_entries` as well.  
  
**Note:** If you want this role also to be able to manage [Entry Approvals](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/88-approving-or-rejecting-entries-in-gravityview), please enable the `gravityview_moderate_entries` capability as well.

### 6) Add the role by clicking "Add Role"

![Screenshot of the add role button](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fc13223a10d7e43619e8b/file-iaPpfFZ90d.png)

Now you've got the Role set up; we need to assign the new role to an existing user.

### 7) Go to the Users menu and click All Users

### 8) Click the user you want to add the moderation role

![Screenshot of the user actions in the All Users page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fc27c8ae44905ae2cc903/file-8BPI0jZIrL.png)

### 9) Under "Roles", check the newly-created "Entry Moderator" role

![Screenshot of the roles section under user profile](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/637fc1f85af7a97b505052cb/file-lobCiZoKl6.png)Make sure to hit the "Update User" button to save the user settings.

### And that's it!

Now the user will be able to view, edit, and (if you enabled it), delete any entry.
