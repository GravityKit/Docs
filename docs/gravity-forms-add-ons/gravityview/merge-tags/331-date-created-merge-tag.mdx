# {date_created} Merge Tag

### The `{date_created}` Merge Tag allows you to display the date an entry was created.

By default, the `{date_created}` Merge Tag will format the entry using the WordPress "Date Format" setting from the [General Options screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_Screen).

### Example usage:

- `{date_created}` will output `February 21, 2016`

Note: **All examples will use February 21, 2016 at 03:09:24 pm GMT**. There is no special meaning to this date (unless there isâ€”let us know!).

### Add the time to the output

- `:time` Adds "`at [time]`" to the output, where `[time]` is formatted using the Time Format setting from the [General Options screen](https://codex.wordpress.org/Settings_General_Screen).

### Format the output using [PHP date format](https://codex.wordpress.org/Formatting_Date_and_Time)


:::caution

The :format Merge Tag modifier can only be used with the {date\_created} Merge Tag. If you want a modifier for other Date fields, please [try this plugin instead](https://gravitywiz.com/gravity-forms-date-merge-tags/).

:::caution

**Update (November 2022)**: Gravity Forms now support modifiers for any date field Merge Tags: [https://docs.gravityforms.com/date/#h-modifiers](https://docs.gravityforms.com/date/#h-modifiers)

:::

  Use `:format` to define a custom format for the date output. The format must be defined after `:format`, then a colon, like this `:format:m/d/Y`.

If you want to use a colon in your output, you must escape the colon with a backslash, like this `\:`.

### Examples:

- `{date_created}` will output `February 21, 2016`
- `{date_created:time}` will output `February 21, 2016 at 3:09 pm`
- `{date_created:format:m/d/Y}` will output `02/21/2016`
- `{date_created:format:m/d/Y\ \a\t\ H\:i\:s}` will output `02/21/2016 at 15:09` - note the additional escape character `\` before the colons.

## **{date\_created:human}**

### Let Gravity Forms decide how to output the date for you.

If the entry is *less than a day old*, it will output a relative date using the `[time] ago` format. This cannot be overridden. If you want to customize the format, use the `:diff` modifier and define a custom `:format` instead. See ":diff Modifier" below.

If the entry is *more than a day old*, it will output the date using the blog's Date Format setting. If the `:time` modifier is also defined, it will output "\[date\] at \[time\]" using the website's Date Format and Time Format settings.

### Examples:

- `{date_created:human}`
   - Older than 24 hours: `February 21, 2016`. Format based on blog Date Format setting.
   - If the entry is less than 24 hours old: `14 hours ago`  
        Outputs using Human Time Difference format, but when using `:human`, the output template cannot be changed from `%s ago` like it can with `:diff`.
- `{date_created:human:time}`
   - If the entry is less than 24 hours old: `14 hours ago`
   - Older than 24 hours will output using blog date and time format: `February 21, 2016 at 3:09 pm`

## **{date\_created:diff}**

### Show how long ago an entry was created, not the date itself

`:diff` outputs the time difference from the entry creation date.

`{date_created:diff}` will output different values based on how long ago the entry was created. The standard format is `%s ago`, where `%s` is replaced by the time difference.

- `3 minutes ago`
- `14 hours ago`
- `28 days ago`
- `2 years ago`

When using `:diff`, `:time` and `:human` modifiers will not work.

<a name="override-the-format"></a>

### Override the format

You can use the `:format` parameter to **change the output template**. If we want to output "I submitted the form \[time difference\] in the past", we would use this Merge Tag: `{date_created:diff:format:I submitted the form %s in the past}`:

- `I submitted the form 3 minutes in the past`
- `I submitted the form 14 hours in the past`
- `I submitted the form 28 days in the past`
- `I submitted the form 2 years in the past`

Make sure to keep the `%s` intact; the `%s` represents where the time difference will be inserted.

## **Additional stand-alone modifiers**

You cannot combine these modifiers with other modifiers. If they exist in the Merge Tag, they will be used in the order defined, and the other modifiers will be ignored.

- `:raw` Return the date\_created value, as stored by Gravity Forms in the database (in `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format). 
   - Example: `{date_created:raw}` outputs `2016-02-21 15:09:24`
- `:timestamp` Return a Unix Timestamp of the entry creation. This is useful when comparing date values using `greater_than` and `less_than` in combination with the [\[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode). 
   - Example: `{date_created:timestamp}` generates `1456067364` ([see here](http://www.timestampgenerator.com/1456067364/#result))
