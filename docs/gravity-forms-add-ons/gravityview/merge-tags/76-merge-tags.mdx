# Merge Tags

GravityView can use all [Merge Tags available in Gravity Forms](https://docs.gravityforms.com/category/user-guides/merge-tags-getting-started/), and also offers additional Merge Tags.

### Merge Tags can be used in many ways:

- Create unique content per entry with the [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field)
- Modify field Settings (use [as the field label](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/72-working-with-field-labels) or in [CSS classes](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/272-adding-custom-css-classes-to-fields-or-widgets)).
- Create [custom Single Entry page titles](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/121-changing-the-single-entry-page-title)
- Use Merge Tags [with the \[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) to compare entry values and show different content based on those values
- Customize [Recent Entries Widget content](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/223-the-recent-entries-widget)

## Merge Tags added by GravityView

GravityView adds these Merge Tags:

- `{date_created}` The date an entry was created. [Read how to use it here](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/331-date-created-merge-tag).
- `{date_updated}` The date an entry was last updated. It supports the [same formatting options as {date\_created}](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/331-date-created-merge-tag).
- `{get}` Show data from the URL of a web page. [Learn more](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/314-the-get-merge-tag).
- `{created_by}` Display information about the user who created the entry. [Learn more](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/281-the-createdby-merge-tag).
- `{approval_status}` Display the approval status of an entry ("Approved", "Disapproved", or "Unapproved")
- `{current_post}` Display information about the current Post, Page, View, or another post type. [Learn more](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/412-currentpost-merge-tag).
- `{sequence}` Display the Number Sequence value for the current entry. It will only work in field values. It will not work in View widgets or outside a View (such as Gravity Forms email notifications). [Learn more](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/597-the-sequence-merge-tag).
- `{gv_entry_link:[post id]:[action]}` Links to the current entry. For example: `{gv_entry_link:123:edit}` Links to Edit Entry for a single entry. `123` refers to either the View ID or the ID of the page where the View is embedded. 
   - `[post id]` is the View IDâ€”or the post or page where the View is embedded. If this Merge Tag is used in a View, the default value will be automatically calculated.
   - `[action]` the action to be performed. View Details (`view`), Edit Entry (`edit`), or Delete Entry (`delete`). Default: `view`.
- `{site_url}` Returns the current site URL. This can be helpful when migrating sites or deploying from staging.

####  Pricing Merge Tags 

These Merge Tags are only relevant when a payment has been processed.

- `{payment_date}` The date the payment was received. Formatted using [the same modifiers](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/331-date-created-merge-tag) as `{date_created}`
- `{payment_status}` The current payment status of the entry (ie "Processing", "Failed", "Cancelled", "Approved", etc.)
- `{payment_method}` displays Payment Method value
- `{payment_amount}` displays the payment amount formatted as a currency. Use `{payment_amount:raw}` to display an unformatted number, useful in combination with [the \[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode).
- `{is_fulfilled}` Whether the order has been fulfilled. Displays "Not Fulfilled" or "Fulfilled"
- `{transaction_type}` Indicates the transaction type of the entry/order. "Single Payment" or "Subscription"
- `{transaction_id}` The ID of the transaction returned by the payment gateway
