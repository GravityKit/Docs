# The {is_starred} Merge Tag

Added in GravityView 2.14, the `{is_starred}` Merge Tag will show whether an entry has been.

- If an entry **is starred**, `{is_starred}` is replaced with `1`.
- If an entry **is not starred**, `{is_starred}` is replaced with `0`.

### How to show different content based on whether an entry is starred

Sometimes you want to know whether an entry has been starred [when using the \[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode).

Using the `[gvlogic]` shortcode, you don't need to add anything more than the "if" statement:

```html
[gvlogic if="{is_starred}"]
ü§© This entry is starred!
[else]
üôÅ This entry is not starred
[/gvlogic]
```

Here's how to show content that will appear if an entry is starred, but no content will appear if it is not:

```html
[gvlogic if="{is_starred}"]‚≠êÔ∏è This entry is starred![/gvlogic]
```
