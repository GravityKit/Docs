# The {user} and {created_by} Merge Tag

### About `{created_by}`

The `{created_by}` Merge Tag allows you to display details of the entry creator. It supports all the functionality of the Gravity Forms and **uses the same structure** as the `{user}` Merge Tag [documented on the Gravity Forms website](https://docs.gravityforms.com/user-merge-tag/).

### Difference between `{user}` and `{created_by}`

The `{user}` merge tag displays information about the currently logged-in user.

The `{created_by}` displays information about the entry creator, if there is one.

---

### Usage:

**The user must be logged in when the entry is submitted.** If the user was not logged in when creating the entry, the `{created_by}` Merge Tag will be empty. You can wrap the `{created_by}` Merge Tag with a [\[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) to check for its existence.

- `{created_by:ID}` - Displays the user ID of the entry creator
- `{created_by:display_name}` - Displays the Display Name of the submitting user.
- `{created_by:user_email}` - Displays the email of the submitting user.
- `{created_by:user_login}` - Displays the user login of the submitting user. {user:user\_login}
- `{created_by:[meta_key]}` - Displays the value of whatever user meta key is provided. Any user meta (including custom user meta) can be displayed with this merge tag. 
   - The first and last name of the entry creator: `{created_by:first_name} {created_by:last_name}`
   - The email of the current user: `Thanks for getting in touch, {user:display_name}! We will be in touch here: <a href="mailto:{created_by:user_email}">{user:user_email}</a>.`

### Example

You can add this code to a [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) to link to the entry creator's User Profile page in the WordPress Dashboard:
