# The {user} and {created_by} Merge Tag

The `{created_by}` Merge Tag allows you to display details of the entry creator. It supports all the functionality of the Gravity Forms and uses the same structure as the `{user}` Merge Tag [documented on the Gravity Forms website](https://docs.gravityforms.com/user-merge-tag/).

### **Difference between `{user}` and `{created_by}`**

The `{user}` merge tag displays information about the **currently logged-in user**.

The `{created_by}` displays information about the entry creator, if there is one\*.

\*The user must be logged in when submitting the entry ( [read more about that here](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/717-understanding-how-an-entry-gets-associated-with-a-user)). If the user was not logged in when creating the entry, the `{created_by}` Merge Tag will be empty. You can wrap the `{created_by}` Merge Tag with a [\[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) to check for its existence.

### Usage


:::info

All the Merge Tag modifiers below also work with the {user} Merge Tag. Example: {user:user\_email}.

:::

 - `{created_by:ID}` - Displays the user ID of the entry creator
- `{created_by:display_name}` - Displays the Display Name of the submitting user.
- `{created_by:first_name}` or ` {created_by:last_name}` - The first and last name of the entry creator.
- `{created_by:user_email}` - Displays the email of the submitting user.
- `{created_by:user_login}` - Displays the user login of the submitting user. {user:user\_login}
- `{created_by:[meta_key]}` - This merge tag can display any user meta (including custom user meta). Replace `[meta_key]` with the name of the user meta, example: `{created_by:company_name}`.


:::info

Use this plugin to create and display custom user meta: [Extra User Details](https://wordpress.org/plugins/extra-user-details/).

:::

 ### Example

You can add this code to a [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) to link to the entry creator's User Profile page in the WordPress Dashboard:

```

[gvlogic if="{created_by}" isnot=""]
      <a href="/wp-admin/user-edit.php?user_id={created_by:ID}">Link to Profile</a>
[/gvlogic]
```
