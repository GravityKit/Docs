# Displaying Fields conditionally

There are two methods to conditionally display a field's value on your View based on a value from another field.

You can either do that [using the \[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) inside a Custom Content field, or you can use a new (and much easier) functionality from our [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) called "[Field Conditional Logic](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/753-field-conditional-logic)".

To use the \[gvlogic\] shortcode, you must first add a [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) on your View:

And then we need to write the \[gvlogic\] sentence inside the field options panel:

For the record, here's how our form was created:
