# The {gv_entry_link} Merge Tag


:::danger

This Merge Tag doesn't work inside form notifications.

:::



The {gv\_entry\_link} Merge Tag is very similar to the [\[gv\_entry\_link\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/287-gv-entry-link), but it has limited options and it only returns a URL: `{gv_entry_link:[post id]:[action]}`

For example: `{gv_entry_link:123:edit}` Links to Edit Entry page for the current entry. `123` refers to either the View ID or the ID of the page where the View is embedded.

- `[post id]` is the View IDâ€”or the post or page where the View is embedded. If this Merge Tag is used in a View, the default value will be automatically calculated.
- `[action]` the action to be performed. View Details (`view`), Edit Entry (`edit`), or Delete Entry (`delete`). Default: `view`.

### Usage inside a Custom Content field

This Merge Tag should always be used inside the Entries Fields section of a View to get the context of the entry.

This will generate a link to the Single Entry page of that entry:
