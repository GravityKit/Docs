# The {sequence} Merge Tag

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uqWCtSsmHIQ" width="560"></iframe>

The `{sequence}` Merge Tag displays the same value as a Sequence Number Field, but the Merge Tag can be used inside fields in a View. `{sequence}` can be used inside a Custom Content field, as well as inside field labels and Custom CSS Class field settings.

### Reverse the sequence order

If you want to display the order of entries from high to low, you can "count down" using the `reverse` modifier.

- `{sequence reverse}` Output numbers in descending order. If used, numbers will count down from high to low.

### Change the starting or ending number

You may want to start the sequence from a number that isn't 1 (or if you're using the reverse modifier, you may want to *end* at a number that isn't 1). To do that, set the `start` modifier.

- `{sequence start=[number]}` Set the first number in the sequence, or if also using reverse, set the last number of the sequence

###  Example Merge Tag usage:

- `{sequence}` will output "1" for the first entry, and "10" for the tenth
- `{sequence start=11}` will output "11" for the first entry, and "21" for the tenth
- `{sequence reverse}` will output "10" for the first entry, and "1" for the tenth, if there are 10 total entries in the View.
- `{sequence reverse,start=10}` will output "20" for the first entry, and "10" for the tenth, if there are 10 total entries in the View.
