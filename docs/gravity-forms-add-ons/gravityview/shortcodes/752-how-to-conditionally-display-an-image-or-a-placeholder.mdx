# How to conditionally display an image or a placeholder

If you wish to display an image only if specific criteria match another field's value or even display a placeholder image in case the original image is not present, you can do that with either the \[gvlogic\] shortcode or with the Field Conditional Logic functionality from the [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/).

## Using the \[gvlogic\] shortcode

In this View, the cat named "Charlie" doesn't have a photo:

![Screenshot of the Custom Content field with the gvlogic shortcode inside](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/6037f0f08502d1120e90b4a9/file-3jv4JnG3cx.png)This is the \[gvlogic\] code we used on the image above:

```
[gvlogic if="{Cat Photo:2}"]
<img src="{Cat Photo:2:esc_html}">
[else]
<img src="https://path.to.placeholder.image/no-cat.jpg">
[/gvlogic]
```


:::caution

When outputting a field value inside an HTML tag, always use the Modifier [:esc\_html](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/350-merge-tag-modifiers) to prevent it from breaking your website's HTML.

  And here's our View now with a placeholder image for an empty File Upload field:

## Using Field Conditional Logic


:::caution

To use this feature, you must have installed the Advanced Filter plugin available only to the GravityView + Extensions Bundle or All Access licenses.

:::

  This functionality is more straightforward than using the \[gvlogic\] shortcode because it doesn't require any custom code; it's as simple as specifying the conditions for the Cat Photo field in the View editor:
