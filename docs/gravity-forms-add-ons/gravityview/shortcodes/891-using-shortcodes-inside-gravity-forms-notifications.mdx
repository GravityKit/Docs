# Using shortcodes inside Gravity Forms notifications

When sending a notification, you may want to have a different email subject line based on the value of a field. In that case, [you can use \[gvlogic\]](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode). Unfortunately, Gravity Forms only processes shortcodes inside a notification's Message field (the email body). It does ***not*** process shortcodes inside other fields, such as the Subject.

To process shortcodes inside other notification fields, we will use Gravity Forms‚Äô [gform\_notification](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_notification/) filter. Here's an example of processing shortcodes inside the **To**, **Subject,** and **From Name** fields:


:::info

‚ÑπÔ∏è Only run shortcodes that you know contain safe output! Using a shortcode in these fields has the potential to break the Notifications functionality.

:::

 ```php
/**
* @param array $notification
*/
add_filter( 'gform_notification', function( $notification ) {

	$notification['to']       = do_shortcode( $notification['to'] );
	$notification['subject']  = do_shortcode( $notification['subject'] );
	$notification['fromName'] = do_shortcode( $notification['fromName'] );

	return $notification;
} );
```

Now, you can use shortcodes inside your subject line like this:

```html
[gvlogic if="{Industry:3}" is="Automobiles"]üöò Drive in![else]üö¥ Bike in![/gvlogic]
```
