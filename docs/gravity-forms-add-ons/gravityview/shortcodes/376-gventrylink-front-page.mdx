# Using the [gv_entry_link] on your home page



### Here's a \[gv\_entry\_link\] shortcode in a Custom Content field

### The link points to the View, not to the home page.

Even though the View is embedded on the home page, the link is pointing to the View.

### So how to fix this?

**We need to update the `[gv_entry_link]` shortcode** to be `[gv_entry_link post_id="#"]`, where the number is the page ID of the front page.

### Getting the Page ID

If you know the page ID of the front page, update the shortcode to use it. For example, if the page ID is 2, the shortcode would be `[gv_entry_link post_id="2"]`. **The link should work now.**

If you need help finding the page ID, read on!

#### Go to the Settings &gt; Reading page from your Dashboard

There, you will see the "Front page" setting. That is the page we want to find more information about.

#### Click on the name of the page in the "Pages &gt; All Pages" list

#### The page ID will be in the URL as "post=\[number\]"

But this won't work for everyone, because browsers don't always show the full URL.

#### Don't see the full URL and need to find the Page ID?

Go to Plugins &gt; Add New, then search for "Reveal IDs". Click the Install Now button, then click Activate to activate the plugin.

#### You will now see an ID column next to each page.

That number is the page ID we've been looking for. Sorry it's so hard to find!
