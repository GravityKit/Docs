# Embedding a second View inside the Single Entry page


:::info

Embedding is also called "nesting".

:::



It's possible to embed a secondary View inside the Single Entry page of the main View by using the `[gravityview]` shortcode and a [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) (the secondary View must use the Table or List View layouts).

Also, it's possible to use a field value from the entry in question to filter this second View by using the [`search_field` and `search_value` parameters](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/73-using-the-shortcode) of the `[gravityview]` shortcode.

On the Single Entry page of the main View, we add a Custom Content code with the `[gravityview]` shortcode inside:

Here's what it looks like on the front end:
