# How to highlight an entry from a specific date

## You can use `[gvlogic]` shortcode to compare dates

In the example below, we highlight today's entries by comparing the date stored on the field "Date B" with today's date (using the Gravity Forms Merge Tag `{date_dmy}`).

Let's start by adding a [Custom Content field](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) to our View:

![Screenshot showing the View editor with the Custom Content field added](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/632cb6728b1e2859512fcc40/file-9SJdldDWmG.png)

We click the cog icon to configure the contents of the field, then add the following code:

```html
[gvlogic if="{Date B:3:dmy}" is="{date_dmy}"]
	<span style="background-color: green; color: white; padding: 2px 5px;">
		Itâ€™s Today
	</span>
[/gvlogic]
```

The code uses [the `[gvlogic]` shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) to check whether the date of the "Date B" field is the same as today's date. If so, the code will output HTML that shows the words "It's Today" with a green background.

Here's how the Custom Content field appears, when configured:

And this screenshot shows how the Custom Content field appears in the View:
