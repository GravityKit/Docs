# Use [gvlogic]  to show (or hide) content anywhere on your site

## Use our shortcode to show and hide content on your site

GravityView adds multiple shortcodes to WordPress ( [see the list of GravityView shortcodes here](https://docs.gravitykit.com/category/322-shortcodes)), and one allows you to show or hide content based on rules you define: the [\[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode).

*What's a shortcode? It's is a bit of text that you can add to your post or page that lets you perform complex functions without using code. A shortcode is a shortcut, and you can tell a shortcode because shortcodes are wrapped in square brackets, like this: `[example]`.*

## The `[gvlogic]` shortcode works everywhere

Some GravityView functionality only works inside a View, but the `[gvlogic]` shortcode works across your whole site: in posts, pages, Views, WordPress widgetsâ€¦everywhere!

When you use `[gvlogic]` somewhere that isn't a View, you will be comparing values that aren't based on Gravity Forms data, so **make sure to use Merge Tags that don't rely on form and field values**.

### Use these Merge Tags with with `[gvlogic]` anywhere on your site

No matter where you use `[gvlogic]`, you can use these Merge Tags to show or hide content:

**GravityView Merge Tags**

- [{current\_post} - Access details of the current post or page](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/412-currentpost-merge-tag)
- [{user} - Access details of the current user](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/281-the-createdby-merge-tag)
- [{get} - Access details of the URL query string](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/314-the-get-merge-tag)

**Gravity Forms Merge Tags**

- `{admin_email}` The email of the site administrator
- `{admin_url}` The URL of the dashboard for the site
- `{logout_url}` The URL to log out of the site

## Examples

### Show a message to the logged-in user:

If you want to show a message on a page to logged-in users, you can use the `[gvlogic]` shortcode, like this:

```
[gvlogic if="{user:ID}" isnot=""]
 {user:display_name}, thanks for being logged in!
[/gvlogic]
```

If the user's display name is "Ellen Ripley", when she is logged-in, she will see: "Ellen Ripley, thanks for being logged in!"

### Show a form only to logged-out users, and a View to logged-in users

If you want to gather data for visitors and allow logged-in users of your site to see that content, you can do that with the following code. It will display a Gravity Forms form to logged-out users and will display the submitted entries in a GravityView View to logged-in users:

```
[gvlogic if="{user:ID}" isnot=""]  Here are the form submissions:
 [gravityview id="45"]
[else]  
 Please fill out this form!
 [gravityforms id="123"]
[/gvlogic]
```

### Show content only to visitors arriving from Google Adwords

When a user visits your site from Google Adwords, they have `?gclid=xxxxxx` added to the URL. If you want to display content targeted only to them, you can:

```
[gvlogic if="{get:gclid}" isnot=""]
Hi! We have a <em>special offer</em> for Google customers!
[/gvlogic]
```

The possibilities are endless for how to conditionally show and hide content on your site using the `[gvlogic]` shortcode.
