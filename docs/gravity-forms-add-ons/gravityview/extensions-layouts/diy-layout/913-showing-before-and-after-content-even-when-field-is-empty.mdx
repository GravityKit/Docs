# Showing Before and After Content even when field is empty

If the value of a field is empty, the Before Content and After Content sections won't show up:

If you still need the contents of these two sections to appear regardless of the field's value, then you'll need to use this code snippet below:

```
add_filter('gravityview-diy/field-value/show-settings-content-if-empty', '__return_true');
```
