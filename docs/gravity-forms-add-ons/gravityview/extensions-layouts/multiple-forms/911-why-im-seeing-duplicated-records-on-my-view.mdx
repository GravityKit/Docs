# Why I'm seeing duplicated records on my View?

If your View is using Multiple Forms, then you might see duplicated entries from the main form showing up.

Let's assume we have two forms: Teams and Players.

On the Teams form, we have **two** entries: Arizona Rockets and New York Comets.

On the Players form, we have **five** entries. Three are associated with the Arizona Rockets, and two entries are associated with the New York Comets.

The Player form entries are connected with the Teams form by the same Team Number field.

Connecting these two forms:
