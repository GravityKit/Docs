# I don't see the option to join multiple forms

![The Multiple Forms join box allows you to combine data from several forms](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5d7b9e3f04286364bc8f1619/file-FN6QKjROwD.png)

If you have installed and activated the [Multiple Forms extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/multiple-forms/), but you don't see the option to combine data from multiple forms, please make sure you have created and published a View.

**You must first create and publish a View**. The Multiple Forms functionality will appear on the View editor page in the Data Source box below the available forms dropdown.
