# Getting Started With Multiple Forms


:::info

**Note**: The Multiple Forms extension is still in Beta, which means we're working on adding new features and improving functionality.

:::



In this article, we’ll show you how to get set up with the Multiple Forms extension.

##  Installing Multiple Forms

You can install the Multiple Forms extension from inside WordPress. Simply hover over "GravityKit", click "Products &amp; Licenses", scroll down to “Multiple Forms” and click "Install Now".

![The Install Now button for the GravityView Multiple Forms extension, on the GravityKit Products & Licenses page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/63a5619c19e761267717239a/file-1KhQ2t2tml.png)You can now start combining data from multiple Gravity Forms on your website.

## How Does it Work?

Multiple Forms allows you to join data in two different ways:

- Left Join (default)** – Display all data from form #1, regardless of whether the fields in form #2 have content.
- **Inner Join ("strict entry matching")** – Only display entries from form #1 that have values in form #2 (see how to enable this below).

Here's a graphic to help you visualize these two ways of combining and displaying data.

## Joining Multiple Forms Together

Start by creating a new View and select your first form as a data source. Now, click the button that says "Add Join Condition" to add a second form.

This should be a field common to both forms (in the example below, we're using the "Email" field).

After selecting a View layout, you can now add fields from both forms to your View layout.

## Enabling Strict Entry Matching

To enable "strict entry matching", scroll down to the View Settings and check the box that says "Strict Entry Match".

When you're done, check out your View on the front end.
