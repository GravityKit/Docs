# How to always display featured entries, regardless of search results

If you would like to always show featured entries, even if the current View search would exclude the entries from being shown, you can do so by adding the following code:

```php
/**
* Allow override of default behavior, which is to respect search queries.
*
* @param boolean $always_show_featured_entry If returned true, featured entries will be shown even if the search doesn't match the entry
*/
add_filter('gravityview_featured_entries_always_show', '__return_true');
```
