When the extension has finished installing, click *Activate*. Now you can start marking entries as “featured”.

## Marking Entries as “Featured”

First, hover over *Forms* and click *Forms*. Now hover over your form and click on the *Entries* link. On the Entries page, you’ll see a list of all your form entries. To mark an entry as featured, simply click the star icon on the left.

The star will turn orange for entries that are featured.
