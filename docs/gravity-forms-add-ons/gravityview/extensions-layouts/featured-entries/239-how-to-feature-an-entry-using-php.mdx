# How to feature an entry using PHP

If you want to modify whether an entry is featured using PHP instead of by starring an entry in WordPress Dashboard, you can do so by using the `gravityview_featured_entries_enable` filter.

Please note that entries featured using this method won't be able to move to the top even if the View is set to `Move Featured Entries to top`.

### The parameters passed to `gravityview_featured_entries_enable`

- $enable\_featured\_entry *(boolean)* Whether to enable featured entries for this entry
- $view *(GravityView\_View)* The current GravityView\_View instance
- $entry *(array)* Gravity Forms entry array

By returning false, the `$entry` will not be featured. By returning `true`, the entry will be featured.

### Some sample code:
