# Setting up sharing buttons with JetPack



## Once Sharing is enabled, click on the "Configure your sharing buttons link"

![A link that says Configure your sharing buttons](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5f333d342c7d3a352e90ab90/file-sfvEixmbXy.png)

### You will be redirected to a page on WordPress.com called "Marketing"

On this page, you can configure which sharing buttons to display and what they will look like. Please make sure to check "Pages" and "Views" in the Options panel:

<span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 14px;">If you are embedding your View on a Page using the <span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 14px; color: rgb(187, 0, 0);">`[gravityview]`</span> shortcode, ensure both "Pages" and "Views" are checked. If "Pages" is not checked, the Sharing Buttons won't display on the embedded View.</span>

<span style="background-color: initial; font-size: 14px;"></span>The same goes for Posts; if you're embedding it in a Post, check the "Posts" checkbox.

### Edit the View you would like to add Sharing buttons to

1. Click the "Add Field" button where you want to add the sharing links
2. Click the "Sharing" field at the bottom of the field picker

Now open up the sharing settings by clicking on the gear icon next to the Sharing field.

### Configure the Sharing field

1. You can choose which plugin you will use between JetPack or your WordPress website itself under the "Sharing Plugin" dropdown
2. Uncheck the "Show Label" box to hide the label displayed next to the Sharing buttons. (The default label is "Sharing")
3. Or customize the label (optionally) using Merge Tags to include data from the entry itself

### Update your View

Or "Publish" it, if it's not already live.

### Voil√†! Your sharing buttons will be visible where you placed them in the View
