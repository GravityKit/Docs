# I can't type in a relative date


:::info

**Version 2 of Advanced Filtering no longer has this issue.** This article relates to Version 1 of Advanced Filtering.

:::



If you aren't able to type in [a relative date](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php) into an Advanced Filter date field, please toggle the comparison dropdown, as shown below:

![If unable to type a relative date into the filter field, select another date comparison option, then return to the option you wish to use. You will now be able to enter a relative date.](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/file-slHxYPuohA.gif)After toggling the dropdown, you will be able to type again.
