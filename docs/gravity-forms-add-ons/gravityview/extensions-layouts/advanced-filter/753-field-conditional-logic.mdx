# Field Conditional Logic


:::info

Field Conditional Logic requires the [Advanced Filter](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) extension to be installed on your website.

:::



This functionality is more accessible than using the [\[gvlogic\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/252-gvlogic-shortcode) because it doesn't require any previous knowledge of the shortcode parameters; it's as simple as specifying the conditions for each field on the View editor.

## How to use it

In this View, the cat named "Charlie" doesn't have a photo:

We'll now use Field Conditional Logic on the Cat Photo field to display a placeholder image when no photos are present:

Once the field configuration panel shows up, we specify the condition only to display the field if it's not empty. If it's empty, we'll display the placeholder image instead:

And here's our View now with a placeholder image for the cat named Charlie:

This functionality works for all field types, including [Custom Content fields](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field). You can also combine multiple clauses using our AND and OR operators:
