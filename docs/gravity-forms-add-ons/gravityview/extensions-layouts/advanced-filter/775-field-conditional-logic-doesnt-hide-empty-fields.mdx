# Field Conditional Logic doesn't hide empty fields

[Field Conditional Logic](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/753-field-conditional-logic), a feature introduced in version 2.1 of the [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/), doesn't hide empty fields from showing up on your View; it just outputs a different value or leaves the value empty.

If your View is showing empty rows like this:

![A View showing empty rows](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/641cd36ac50436764befded0/file-iLo6NfO9aj.png)

It means you are probably using the same Field Conditional logic on all fields (columns) added to your View.

Please consider using Advanced Filters to hide these empty entries instead:
