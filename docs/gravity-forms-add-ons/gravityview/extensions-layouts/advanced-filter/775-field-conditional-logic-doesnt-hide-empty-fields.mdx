# Field Conditional Logic doesn't hide empty fields

[Field Conditional Logic](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/753-field-conditional-logic), a feature introduced in version 2.1 of the [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/), doesn't hide empty fields from showing up on your View; it just outputs a different value or leaves the value empty.
