# Filtering a View using the Assignee field from Gravity Flow

If you wish to only display entries on your View where the Assignee field is equal to the **currently logged-in user**, then you must use this expression on your Advanced Filter logic:

![an Advanced Filtering condition in GravityView for Workflow Assignee is Current User](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/633425409f7c1931ee0043b2/file-bpX9M8FDhM.png)

About the Assignee field

According to [Gravity Flow's documentation](https://docs.gravityflow.io/article/29-the-workflow-fields):

> The Assignee Field is an advanced workflow field that can be added to a Gravity Form and can be used to allow users to choose between Users, Roles and other Assignee fields.
