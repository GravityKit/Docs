# Why can't I see the Fields dropdown?


:::info

**This doc is for an earlier version of Advanced Filters**. In Advanced Filters Version 2.0 and newer, field filters are always visible without needing to save the View.

:::



In Advanced Filter versions earlier than 2.0, filter fields were only visible once a View had been saved. The View didn't need to be published (it could be a Draft), but it did need to be saved.
