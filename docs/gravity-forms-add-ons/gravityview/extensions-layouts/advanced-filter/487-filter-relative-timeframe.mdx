# How to show only entries from the current day, week, month, or year


:::info

ðŸ’¡ New on Gravity Guide: an Advanced Filter extension course with step-by-step instructions and videos. [Check it out âž¡](https://gravity.guide/course/using-gravityview-advanced-filter-to-easily-display-subsets-of-your-view/)

:::



The [Advanced Filtering](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) extension allows you to filter using date ranges. To modify your filters: edit your View, scroll to the Settings Panel and click on the Filter &amp; Sort tab.

### Show only Gravity Forms entries submitted this month

Thanks to the wonders of [PHP relative dates](http://php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.relative.php), we can create filters that show entries only from this month like this:

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/609efb49bbbb0e786d30bbb6/file-IWCdr4q18a.png)  
To show entries from the current month, we do a few mental gymnastics: instead of saying "show entries from this month," we tell Advanced Filtering to show entries that come *between* last month and next month. The filters shown are configured to show entries that are after ("is after") last month and before ("is before") next month.

#### To show only entries submitted this week

To show entries from last week, set Entry Date filters to:

- "is after", value: "Sunday last week"
- "is before", value: "monday next week"

#### To show only entries submitted today

To show entries from today, set Entry Date filters to:

- "is after", value: "yesterday"
- "is before", value: "tomorrow"

#### Show only entries from last month

To show entries from last month, you'll need two add an additional OR clause with the "is on" operator:

- "is after", value: "first day of last month" OR "is on", value: "first day of last month".
- AND
- "is before", value: "last day of last month" OR "is on", value: "last day of last month".

#### This relative date technique will work for any Gravity Forms date field

You can use this approach with any [Date field](https://docs.gravityforms.com/date/), allowing you to show the following:

- **Deadlines** that are approaching
- **Fulfillment dates** happening this week use (greater than "last Sunday" and less than "next Monday")
- **Entries** created today (greater than "yesterday" and less than "tomorrow")
