# How to disable email notifications for reviews

Sometimes you might want to prevent authors of form submissions from receiving an email notification when a review is left on their entries.

To disable these email notifications, you need to uncheck these two options in the Discussion menu of WordPress:

Note: this will also disable email notifications for comments left on blog posts.
