# How to change the description of the Star Rating titles on hover

When hovering over a star to rate an entry, the titles are by default:

1. 1 star
2. 2 stars
3. 3 stars
4. 4 stars
5. 5 stars

But what if you have a custom rating scale that you want to display when users hover over the star? For example, **if you wanted to use Netflix's rating scale**: Hated it, Didn't like it, It was okay, Liked it, Loved it, you can use the code below ([here's how to add the code](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)).
