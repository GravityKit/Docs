# Is it possible to style the map?

The [Maps Premium View](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/maps/) does allow you to add your custom CSS styles to change the look of the map. You can enter your custom styles in the Custom Map Styles box in View Settings &gt; Maps:

![Add your own CSS in the Custom Map Styles box in View Settings - Maps](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5da888bb04286364bc908c0a/file-yIiepUweuA.png)

Another way to change the look and feel of your maps is to download and install the [Snazzy Maps plugin](https://snazzymaps.com/plugins/wordpress). Snazzy Maps has hundreds of prebuilt styles to choose from. You'll have to [sign up for an account](https://snazzymaps.com/account/developer) and get a free API key via the Snazzy Maps website, but once you do that, you can change the look of your map from the Appearance menu in WordPress with just a few clicks.

Here's an example of a Map View with a Snazzy Maps style applied:
