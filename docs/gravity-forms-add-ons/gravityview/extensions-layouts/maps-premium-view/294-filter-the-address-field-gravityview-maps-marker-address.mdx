# Filter the address field: gravityview/maps/marker/address

When the address field is not stored in a regular Address field type or if you would need to perform string manipulation to the address field value before the Maps Premium View tries to geocode the address, there is a filter hook for that - `gravityview/maps/marker/address` - as shown in the following code snippet:

```php

/**
* Filter the address field content before geocoding
* @param string $address Address value
* @param array $entry Gravity Forms entry object
*/
function my_gv_maps_address_value( $address, $entry ) {
// Note: Replace the MY_FORM_ID by the Form ID where you'll want to apply this code.
   if ( 'MY_FORM_ID' != $entry['form_id'] ) {
       return $address;
   }
   // do something to $address
   return $address;
}
add_filter( 'gravityview/maps/marker/address', 'my_gv_maps_address_value', 10, 2 );
```
