# About GravityView Maps geocoding

Geocoding is the process of converting an address to geographic coordinates (Latitude and Longitude). GravityView's Maps extension does this automatically using the Google Maps API.

When generating a new Google Maps API Key, you can choose if your key will be restricted to only work on your website or unrestricted. Ideally, the key should always be restricted since this key will be exposed to the source code of your website. However, due to the difficulty of restricting an API Key on Google's website, we provided an option in GravityKit's Settings page to use an unrestricted key safely without exposing this key to the public.
