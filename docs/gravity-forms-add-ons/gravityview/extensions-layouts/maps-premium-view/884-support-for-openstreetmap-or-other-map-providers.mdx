# Support for OpenStreetMap or other map providers

Unfortunately, the Maps Layout only supports [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps) at this moment.

[Please let us know](https://gravityview.uservoice.com/forums/238941-gravityview-ideas) if you would like us to support other Map Providers.
