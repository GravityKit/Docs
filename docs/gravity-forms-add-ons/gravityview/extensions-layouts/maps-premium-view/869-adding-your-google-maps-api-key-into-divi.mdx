# Adding your Google Maps API Key into Divi

### Do you see "This page can't load Google Maps correctly."?

If you are using the [Divi theme](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) on your website, you might experience a loading problem on your View Map, just like in the image below:

This error usually means there is a conflict between two (or more) Google Maps API Keys being loaded simultaneously. In these situations, GravityView won't load the Google Maps API Key from its Settings page. Instead, it'll use the one entered into Divi's Settings.

To fix this problem, please make sure to use the same Google Maps API Key on both components.

On the Divi menu on your Dashboard, click on the Theme Options page, General tab, find the Google API Key input and paste the same Google Maps Key from your GravityView's Settings page there:

That's it! Your map will now load correctly.

### How can I tell if I'm using the Divi theme?

Log into WordPress, click on the Appearance menu, then click on the Themes sub-menu link. If you're running Divi, it will show as activated.
