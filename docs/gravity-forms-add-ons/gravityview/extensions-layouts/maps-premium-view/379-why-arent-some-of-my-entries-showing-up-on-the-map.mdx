# Why aren't some of my entries showing up on the map?

If you are using the [**Map View**](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/map/) layout for your View or the **Multiple Entries Map** widget and noticed that some of your entries are not showing up on the map, then the cause might be the **Number of entries per page** option:

![GravityView "Settings" box with the "Multiple Entries" tab selected and the "Number of entries per page" setting highlighted](https://i.gravitykit.com/8dbHHF+)

Make sure to increase this number to display all the missing entries.
