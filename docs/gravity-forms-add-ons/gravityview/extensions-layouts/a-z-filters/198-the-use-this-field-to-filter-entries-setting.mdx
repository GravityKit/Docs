# The "Use this field to filter entries" setting

**This setting is required for the filter to work correctly.**

If you want the links to filter users based on first name, for example, you would choose the <q>First Name</q> field.

### Filtering Example

Let's say your form has entries with the following people's names:

- Amanda Doe
- Charlie Rondel
- Faye Lowry
- George Smith
- Julie Fallon
- Rachel McDonnell
- Raurie McDonnell
- Steve Wang

Then you visit the View and click on the <q>R</q> link in the A-Z Filter widget.

#### What happens when you click on the <q>R</q> link

- If you chose the field <q>Last Name</q> when you set up the widget, the list would be narrowed to <q>Charlie Rondell</q> because <q>R</q> is the first letter of the Last Name value.
- If you choose <q>First Name</q> as the field to filter by, there will be two entries: <q>Rachel McDonnell</q> and <q>Raurie McDonnell</q>. That is because their names both begin with <q>R</q>.
