# Is there a way to style the PDF on DataTables?

You can style the PDFs by modifying the JavaScript passed to DataTables. This is advanced. We recommend working with [Codeable.io](https://codeable.io/?ref=w8Tga) to implement this customization.

You would pass the script [custom styling rules for the pdfmake library](https://pdfmake.github.io/docs/document-definition-object/tables/) to the DataTables configuration. Use the `gravityview_datatables_js_options` filter to modify the options.
