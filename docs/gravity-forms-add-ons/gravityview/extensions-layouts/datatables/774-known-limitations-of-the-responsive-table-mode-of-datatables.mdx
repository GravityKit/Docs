# Known limitations of the Responsive Tables mode of DataTables

![Screenshot of the Responsive Tables mode on a table](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5ce70e032c7d3a32d2a4bdb0/file-gTipur7dyw.png)

The [Responsive Tables mode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/578-how-to-enable-the-responsive-tables-mode) of DataTables is excellent to group additional columns on your View to save horizontal space but has some known limitations:

- Fancybox Gallery: Items are duplicated when the File Upload field is hidden by DataTables Responsive Mode
- The Approve Entries field doesn't work when the Responsive Tables mode is active
- The DataTables built-in search field can only search on visible columns
- Columns hidden by the Responsive Tables modes of DT can't be edited by [GravityEdit](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravityview-inline-edit/)
