# Scroller (DataTables Setting)

The Scroller setting allows large datasets to be drawn on the screen in one continuous page. The aim of Scroller for DataTables is to make rendering large data sets fast.

The table size is fixed as the data is displayed in a continuous table.

In this example, the scroll wheel is being used. The table is not automatically scrolling.

Note: Scroller will not work well if your View has row content of varying height.
