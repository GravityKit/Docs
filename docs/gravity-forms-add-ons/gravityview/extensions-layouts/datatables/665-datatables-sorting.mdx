# My DataTables View is not sorting properly

When creating or editing a View with [the DataTables Extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/), you can specify a field to sort by and a sort direction like so:

![Setting the field and direction to use for sorting a DataTables View](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/580e1ca7c697915f88a3741e/file-9V5tb3GIvO.jpg)

Due to the way the DataTables Extension stores information using the browser, the View may retain a sort setting.

**To clear sorting, add `?cache` to the end of the View URL.** For example, `https://example.com/view/datatables-sort/` becomes `https://example.com/view/datatables-sort/?cache` â€” this will force the browser to reload the View without sorting.

You can also permanently fix this by adding the following code to your theme's functions.php file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rafaehlers/0b99373ad70037027668e0020d6e18bf.js" type="text/javascript"></script> If you're not sure how to add code samples to your website, please see the following article: [Where to put code samples](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)
