# How to disable the table state saving?

By default, the [DataTables Extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/) stores information like pagination position, display length, filtering, sorting, etc., using the browser.

To accomplish that, add the following code [to your theme's functions.php file](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples):
