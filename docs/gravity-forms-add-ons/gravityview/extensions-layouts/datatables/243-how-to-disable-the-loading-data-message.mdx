# How to disable the "Loading Data" message

If you are using the DataTables extension and would like to disable the display of a 'processing' indicator, like the message "Loading Data..." when the table is being processed (e.g. a sort), then you'll need to add the following plugin to your installation. You may also just copy the code to your theme's functions.php file ([see how](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/luistinygod/119735824defc936fd2d.js" type="text/javascript"></script> Having this message enabled is particularly useful for tables with large amounts of data where it can take a noticeable amount of time to sort the entries.
