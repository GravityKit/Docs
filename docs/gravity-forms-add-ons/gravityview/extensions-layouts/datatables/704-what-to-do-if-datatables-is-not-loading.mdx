# What to do if DataTables is not loading

If DataTables isn't loading for your site, it's often because there's a conflict with another plugin.

Plugins can cause errors that add unexpected content into DataTables.

### 1. Disable all plugins except for Gravity Forms, GravityView, and DataTables

Then try again. Does the table load normally? If so, a plugin is the culprit. Re-enable plugins one-at-a-time and reload the page until you find the plugin causing the problem. Once you do, [contact support](mailto:mailto:support@gravityview.co) and we will work with the plugin author to resolve this conflict.

### 2. Add this code or install a small plugin

DataTables expects a certain number of characters.
