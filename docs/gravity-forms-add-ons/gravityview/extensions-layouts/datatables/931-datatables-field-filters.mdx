# DataTables Field Filters


:::caution

This feature requires DataTables 3.0 and GravityView 2.15 or newer.

:::



[DataTables](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/) 3.0 introduced Field Filters. This functionality adds individual search fields to the table header or footer (or both at the same time) for each column on your View:

This powerful functionality allows you to perform [data drilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_drilling) (also known as drill down) searches by filtering multiple columns at the same time:

To enable this functionality, go to the DataTables tab inside the View Settings metabox and check the Enable Field Filters option. It's also possible to choose the location in the table where Field Filters will be displayed.
