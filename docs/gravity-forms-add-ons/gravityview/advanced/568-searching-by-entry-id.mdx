# How do I filter by a specific entry ID?

If you want to create a link to a View that goes to the Multiple Entries context but only shows entries that are pre-filtered to a single entry based on its ID, you can do that two different ways:

### 1. Using the Search Bar

1. Add a Search Bar widget to your View
2. Add an Entry ID field
3. Save the View
4. Go to your View URL and add `?gv_id=123` to the page URL, where `123` is the number of the entry

### 2. Using Advanced Filtering

*Note: This requires the [Advanced Filter extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/), included in the GravityView + Extensions Bundle and All Access licenses.*

1. Edit the View and go to View Settings
2. Click on Filter &amp; Sort
3. Add a filter to the View where "Entry ID" "is"
4. Choose the name of the URL filter you would like to use. In this example, we are using a placeholder `ParameterName`
5. Add a [{get} Merge Tag](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/314-the-get-merge-tag) as to the filter value, using your parameter name (in this example, `{get:ParameterName}`
6. Save your View
7. Access your View and add the Entry ID to the URL like this: `https://example.com/view-page/?ParameterName=123`, where `123` is the Entry ID.
