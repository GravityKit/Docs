# Calculating a person's age based on a date field

Ever wanted to calculate someone else's age based on a date field? That's possible using the `[gv_age]` shortcode.

### Shortcode Parameters

The `[gv_age]` shortcode requires two parameters to calculate age.

- `entry_id` - The ID of the entry for the age calculation. Can use the `{entry_id}` Merge Tag or a numeric entry ID.
- `field_id` - The ID of the date field where date of birth is stored.

###  Example

This shortcode will calculate the ages for all entries. Date of birth is stored in a date field with an ID of 44:

```
[gv_age entry_id="{entry_id}" field_id="44" /]
```

Adding the `[gv_age]` shortcode to a [Custom Content](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/111-using-the-custom-content-field) field:

![Entering the [gv_age] shortcode into the Options screen of a Custom Content field](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5e18d1d32c7d3a7e9ae60d36/file-gt20qq6h13.png)

The output:

Now that we have the age displayed, we can enter a label for the Custom Content field:

You'll need this code to enable the `[gv_age]` shortcode:
