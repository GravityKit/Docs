# How to navigate to an HTML anchor after search

Do you want the Search Bar to navigate to an HTML anchor on the page after a search is performed? If so, you can add the following code to your site:

```php

/**
* Modify the action of the Search Bar form to navigate to #site-content anchor after search
*
* @param string $url Where the form submits to.
*
* @returns string Modified URL with anchor added
*/
add_filter( 'gravityview/widget/search/form/action', function ( $url ) {
	return $url . '#site-content';
} );
```
