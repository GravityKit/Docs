# Edit Entry: How to disable Gravity Forms User Registration feeds from being updated

GravityView's Edit Entry functionality automatically updates users when a form is connected to the [Gravity Forms User Registration Add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/user-registration/). This is the case even when the User Registration Add-on action is set to "Create" and not set to "Update".

To change this behavior, add the following code to your website:

```php
add_filter( 'gravityview/edit_entry/user_registration/trigger_update', '__return_false' );
```


:::info

Read here how to add these code samples to your website: [Where to put code samples.](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)

:::

  After adding this code, User Registration feeds will not be processed when editing an entry in GravityView.
