# Edit Entry: How to disable Gravity Forms User Registration feeds from being updated

GravityView's Edit Entry functionality automatically updates users when a form is connected to the Gravity Forms User Registration Add-on. This is the case even when the User Registration Add-on action is set to "Create" and not set to "Update".

To change this behavior, add the following code to your site ([here's how](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)):

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/1cc9e5138eb1085f88d7.js" type="text/javascript"></script> After adding this code, User Registration feeds will not be processed when editing an entry in GravityView.
