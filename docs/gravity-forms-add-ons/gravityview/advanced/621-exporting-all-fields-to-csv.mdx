# Exporting all fields to CSV

When [exporting entries to CSV](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/491-csv-export), only the fields configured in the View will be exported to your CSV file. You can export all the fields from your form, however, by creating a View that includes all fields:

![Adding all fields to a View](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/5d56c2530428634552d849d8/file-RTVIetRFj0.png)

The View does not have to be publicly available on your website, but you can add /csv/ to the end of the View's URL to download a CSV file containing all fields.
