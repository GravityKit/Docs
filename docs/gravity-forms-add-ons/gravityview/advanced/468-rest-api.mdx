# REST API Endpoints

GravityView 2.0 features a new simple but powerful REST API that allows read-only access to Views and Entries.

There are four endpoints in the `/wp-json/gravityview/v1/` namespace:

## /views

Returns a list of all the views available to the current user along with the needed fields to render their layouts and some additional information. Form/View administrators can access the connected form, View settings, etc.

| URL Parameter | What it does | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | Set the current page number | `1` |
| `limit` | Set the number of results returned per page. Set to `0` for all Views. | `10` |

## /views/$id

Same as `/views` but for one specific View.

## /views/$id/entries.json or (.html, .csv, or .tsv)

Returns all the entries under the select View. Available in `.json`, `.html` , `.csv`, and `.tsv` format (template used will be the current View template, but can be overridden as needed under a REST context). Only directory-mode entry fields will be included. Extra fields can be added via the `gravityview/rest/entry/fields` filter.

The structure returned is quite simple - a key-value object with ID -&gt; value.

| URL Parameter | What it does | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| `page` | Set the current page number | `1` |
| `limit` | Set the number of results returned per page. Set to `0` for all entries. | `10` |
| `post_id` | Set the "parent" Post or Page ID for the View, as if the View were embedded. | `NULL` |

## /views/$id/entries/$id.json (or .html)

The same as `entries.json`, but only single-mode entry fields will be included. The same filter `gravityview/rest/entry/fields` can be used to alter this behavior.

`.html` format instead of `.json` will return HTML code instead. Useful for lazy-loading pagination, etc.

| URL Parameter | What it does | Default Value |
|---|---|---|
| `post_id` | Set the "parent" Post or Page ID for the View, as if the View were embedded. | `NULL` |

## Authentication

For Views based on a user's login status ( [filter entries created by logged in user](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/issues/1122) , for example) WordPress REST API authentication is required, specifically the `X-WP-Nonce` header, in which all requests are considered unauthenticated. For more information, check out the official REST API documentation [here](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/).

Here's an example:
