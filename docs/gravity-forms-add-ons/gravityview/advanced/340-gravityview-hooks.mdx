# WordPress hooks (actions and filters) available for GravityView

GravityView has inline documentation for most of our hooks. You can find auto-generated documentation of them here:

- [List of Actions](https://codex.gravityview.co/actions.html)
- [List of Filters](https://codex.gravityview.co/filters.html)

### About Hookr

[](http://hookr.io/plugin/) [![Hookr logo](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/about-hookr.png?1457976519)](http://hookr.io/plugin/)> The Hookr plugin annotates the html output of your WordPress install with all executed actions/filters.

Hookr is the best way to see what actions and filters are running on a page. Hookr can help familiarize you with GravityView's hooks.

### Install and activate the Hookr plugin

Go to [Hookr.io's "Plugin" page](https://hookr.io/plugin/) and download, then install the plugin.

### Go to Tools &gt; Hookr to configure the plugin settings

### Visit a View

Now that you have Hookr installed, go to a View on your site. You'll see a bunch of rendered tags, like this.

### Click on one of the hooks listed.
