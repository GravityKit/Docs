# Enable Views to be hierarchical (parent/child)

If you want to define a View as a parent to another View, you should add the following code to your functions.php file:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/16f22a28c255ef931c1d.js" type="text/javascript"></script> There will be no functionality changes to GravityView by enabling this configuration.

### If you experience 404 errors after adding this code:

You need to re-save "permalinks" on your site by:

1. Going to your Dashboard
2. Clicking on the Settings menu item in the sidebar
3. Clicking on "Permalinks"
4. Clicking the "Save Changes" button to save the form

That should fix the 404s.
