# Disable the unfiltered_html capability requirement in GravityView

GravityView requires users to have the `unfiltered_html` and `gravityforms_create_form` capabilities in order to edit a View. The HTML capability is needed because GravityView allows users to add HTML that is output on the front of a site. That ability can be abused to embed malicious scripts on the site.

If you want to disable this requirement, we recommend [modifying a role or cloning a role and adding that capability](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/598-non-administrator-edit-view). You can do so by adding this code to your site ([not sure where to add the code?](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples)):

```php
add_filter( 'gravityview/security/require_unfiltered_html', '__return_false' );
```
