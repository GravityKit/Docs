# How to search for an exact match

GravityView's current search functionality doesn't use an exact match, it uses the *contains* operator, so if you search for the word "Kansas", results containing that word, like "Arkansas", will also show up:

If you wish to change the search functionality to look for an exact match, then you need the function below:

```php

add_filter( 'gravityview_search_operator', function( $operator, $filter = array() ){

	$run_on_views = [100,200]; //The IDs of the Views you'd like to affect [100,200,...]

	if ( ! class_exists( '\GravityView_View_Data' ) ) {
		return $operator;
	}
	$views  = \GravityView_View_Data::getInstance()->views->all();
	if(sizeof($views)){
		foreach ( $views as $view ) {
			if( in_array( $view->ID, $run_on_views ) ){
				$operator = 'is';
			}
		}		
	}
	return $operator;
	
}, 10, 2);
```

Here's the result:

## Searching with empty values

If you have more than two fields on your Search Bar and leave one empty, the search will return the same results as before:

```php
// This disallows empty field values
add_filter( 'gravityview/search/ignore-empty-values', function() {
	return false;
});
```

This way, the search won't return any results until both fields are filled:

![Screenshot showing a View with no results because one search field is empty](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/622b991dc1688a6d26a74673/file-GNZdqCeOUO.png)![Screenshot showing a View with one result because the fields on the search bar are filled](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/622b9938af6f8700f6dae46d/file-4VB0sAbjz2.png)This is perfect for restricting entry results to only those users that know particular details from their submission, like an SSN number in conjunction with a Zip Code or date of birth.

## Defining strict matches for particular fields

If you need to target just a specific field from a specific form, then the code is a little bit more complex. To achieve that, we've created a simple plugin you can [download here](https://github.com/gravityview/gv-snippets/archive/addon/13644-exact-match-field.zip). You'll need to modify the Form ID and Field IDs inside that plugin's code using the plugin editor on your WordPress Dashboard:
