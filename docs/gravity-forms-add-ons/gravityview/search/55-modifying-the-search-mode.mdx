# Modifying the search mode

By default, when searching entries on the View, GravityView will try to match **any** of the conditions requested in the search form.

This means if you have multiple search parameters ("Apple", "Orange"), by default, GravityView will show entries with the words "Apple" OR "Orange" in them.

To modify this behavior, in order to retrieve the entries that match  **all** the search conditions ("Apple" AND "Orange"), download and install this plugin:

### Download the plugin: [GravityView Mod: Search Mode "All"](https://github.com/katzwebservices/gv-snippets/archive/addon/2643-search-mode-all.zip)[](https://github.com/katzwebservices/gv-snippets/archive/addon/2643-search-mode-all.zip)

### Known Conflicts

The search mode will be reset to **all** when using filter conditions powered by the **[Advanced Filter Extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/)**.
