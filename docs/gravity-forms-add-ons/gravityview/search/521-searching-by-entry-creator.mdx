\### Text

In text mode it is possible to search by the creator's nickname, first\_name, last\_name user meta fields, as well as user\_nicename<span style="background-color: initial;">, user\_login, display\_name, user\_email fields. </span>Requires Gravity Forms 2.3+

Two filters are available to control which fields are searched. These are "gravityview/widgets/search/created\_by/user\_meta\_fields" (wp\_usermeta table keys) and "gravityview/widgets/search/created\_by/user\_fields" (wp\_users table columns).

Note: While there are no immediate risks, it is important to evaluate any privacy and security concerns before enabling text mode search. Although the widget does not reveal the values of the fields, in some scenarios an adversary may be able to guess partial information by doing searches and comparing the results.
