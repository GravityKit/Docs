# How to hide results and only display them if a search is performed

Let's say you want to hide your View results, and only display them after a search is performed. That's a built-in setting in GravityView called "Hide View data until search is performed " which you can find in the View Settings box inside the View editor:

With this option checked, your View will look like this before any search is performed:

And, after performing a search:
