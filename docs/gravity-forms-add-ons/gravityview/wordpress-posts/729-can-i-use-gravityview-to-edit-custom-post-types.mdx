# Can I use GravityView to edit Custom Post Types?

GravityView allows you to edit Posts created by a form when [Post Fields](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/245-editable-post-fields) are used.

GravityView can also modify Custom Post Types created with a form. However, only CPTs created with this plugin are editable at this moment: [https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-custom-post-types/](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-custom-post-types/)


:::caution

CPTs created with the [Advanced Post Creation add-on](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/advanced-post-creation/) can't be editable with GravityView yet, unfortunately.
