# Can I upgrade my license later?

### Yes, absolutely!

We have upgrade pricing: you can upgrade anytime and just **pay the price difference**.

For example, if you purchase the Core license first (our most basic one) and decide you want access to extensions (GravityView + Extensions Bundle), you would pay only the difference in price between the Core and GravityView + Extensions Bundle plans.
