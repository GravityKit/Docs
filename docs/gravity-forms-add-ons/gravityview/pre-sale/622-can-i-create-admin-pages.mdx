# Can I create admin pages with GravityView?

GravityView does not work on the backend.

If you want to limit access to your View content, you can manage access to your Views with a membership plugin or by password-protecting the View page. Please refer to this article for more information: [Restricting View content to be members-only](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/86-restrict-view-content-to-members)
