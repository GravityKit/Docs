# Which Gravity Forms license do I need?

Gravity Forms is required to use GravityView. GravityView will work with any Gravity Forms license. For example, you can use the [GravityKit All Access](https://www.gravitykit.com/pricing/) license with the Gravity Forms Basic license. You do not need the Pro or Elite Gravity Forms license to use GravityView.
