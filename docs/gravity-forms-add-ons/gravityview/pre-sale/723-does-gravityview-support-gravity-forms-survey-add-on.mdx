# Does GravityView Support Gravity Forms Survey Add-On?

The [Survey Add-On](https://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/survey/) allows you to easily interact with your users to both collect and analyze data on your target audience. Market research, customer satisfaction, employee surveys, job satisfaction surveys, anything is possible!

GravityView proudly supports it!

## What about Survey Results?

Survey Results are **not yet** supported by GravityView, unfortunately. These are only available on the Gravity Forms back-end.
