# Does GravityView offer a trial?

## ![Money-back guarantee](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Money-back-guarantee.jpg) We don't have trials, but we have an *excellent* refund policy.

Instead of a trial, we have a **30-day money-back guarantee** for all our plugins.

If you don't love GravityView, we are proud to issue fast, no-hassle refunds. On average, during business hours, **we process a refund within 1.5 hours** of receiving the request.

### We refund first, *then* we ask why (with a perk!)

We don't hold you hostageâ€”if you didn't find GravityView plugins the right fit, we don't want you to pay for them!

Once we provide a refund, we ask you to complete a quick questionnaire. Even better, **if you share why you asked for a refund, we will donate $5 to [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com).**

## Buy GravityView with confidence

We stand by our plugins and our support. Hopefully, you'll [give GravityView plugins a try](https://www.gravitykit.com/pricing/) today!
