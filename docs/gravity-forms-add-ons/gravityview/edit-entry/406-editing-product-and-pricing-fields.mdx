# Editing Product and Pricing Fields in Edit Entry

GravityView supports editing Product fields **in GravityView's Edit Entry page**.

This includes the following field types:

- Shipping
- Quantity
- Options
- Product
- Shipping
- Calculation
- Price
- Total \*\*

<sup>\*\*</sup> Total fields can only be displayed when all form fields are shown in the Edit Entry configuration.

### If a payment has been made with real money, the fields won't be editable by default.

**If the entry has transaction data, then the fields will not be editable** by default.

If your form is connected to PayPal (or another payment gateway), when you edit the entry, **it will not update the payment record** in PayPal. So GravityView disables editing product fields by default for entries that have payments associated with them.

If you are fully aware of this and you still want to enable editing the Product and Pricing fields inside GravityView's Edit Entry page, here's a code you can add to your website **(be advised that this code won't allow product fields to be editable inside Gravity Forms Entries page, that will only work for GravityView's Edit Entry page)**:

```php
/** Force showing product fields in the Edit Entry editor. */
add_filter( 'gravityview/edit_entry/hide-product-fields', '__return_false' );
	
```

Not sure where to add the code? [See this doc](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/210-where-to-put-code-samples).

### Coupon fields are handled separately

If you are using the Coupon Addon, you will need to override the display of the field separately. You can override the coupon field using the `gravityview/edit_entry/hide-coupon-fields` filter like so:

```php
/** Force showing product fields in the Edit Entry editor. */
add_filter( 'gravityview/edit_entry/hide-coupon-fields', '__return_false' );
	
```
