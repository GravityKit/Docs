# Configuring Delete Entry

### When editing a View, go to the Settings box and click on "Delete Entry".

![Permissions tab in a View's Settings box](https://i.gravitykit.com/SCiQa2+)

###  Check the "Allow User Delete" checkbox

This will add a "Delete" button next to the "Update" and "Cancel" buttons in the Edit Entry screen.

Note: even if this is unchecked, administrators will still be able to delete entries in the Edit Entry screen. See the screenshots below.

#### With Delete Entry enabled

Note: the button styles will depend on your theme.

#### Configure the Delete Entry field settings

1. Change the link text (default: Delete Entry)
2. Change who can view the link - by default, the Entry Creator can view the link if "Allow User Delete" is enabled. You can change this so only users with more permissions can view the Delete Entry link.
3. Whether to display a label for this field. In Table and DataTables layouts, the label is the column header text.
4. Change the label of the field (Default: Delete Entry)
5. [Field Conditional Logic](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/753-field-conditional-logic) to show/hide the field based on other field values in the entry. Added by the [Advanced Filtering extension](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/)
6. Add custom CSS class to the field container (optional)
