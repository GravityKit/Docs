# Allowing any (and all) logged-in user to Edit entries

In the case you need to allow other users to edit entries even when they didn't have created them or they are not administrators, then you'll need to assign the WordPress capability "gravityforms\_edit\_entries" to their user's role.

This capability will provide the user the ability to edit ANY entry in the frontend of your website using GravityView. (or in the backend, using the Gravity Forms entries screen).

We recommend the usage of the the [Members plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) to limit each user's "gravityforms\_edit\_entries" capability.
