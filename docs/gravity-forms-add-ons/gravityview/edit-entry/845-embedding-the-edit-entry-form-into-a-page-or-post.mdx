# Embedding the Edit Entry form into a Page or Post


:::info

Since GravityView version 2.14.6 it is now possible to embed the Edit Entry page directly into a Page or Post by using the [\[gventry\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/463-gventry-shortcode).

:::



Now it's possible to create a truly "Edit Your Profile" page by directly embedding the entry form into a Page or Post:

In order to achieve this, you need to add the `edit="1"` attribute to the `[gv_entry]` shortcode.

Here's a full example of a \[gventry\] shortcode usage: `[gventry view_id="472" edit="1" entry_id="first"]`.
