# Marking an entry "Unread" after it is edited

When you allow users to edit an entry, you may want to mark it as "Unread" so that you can re-review the changes made.

If you want to do this, you can install this plugin:

### [GravityView Mod: Mark Entry Unread After Edit](https://github.com/gravityview/gv-snippets/archive/addon/6111-unread-after-edit.zip)

After editing an entry in GravityView, it will be marked as unread in Gravity Forms!
