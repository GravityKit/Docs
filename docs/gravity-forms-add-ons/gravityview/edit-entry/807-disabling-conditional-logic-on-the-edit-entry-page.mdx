# Disabling Conditional Logic on the Edit Entry page

If you have a particular use case and need to disable the [conditional logic on the Edit Entry page](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/367-conditional-logic-on-the-edit-entry-page), there's a filter that allows that:

```php
add_filter( 'gravityview/edit_entry/conditional_logic', '__return_false' );
```


:::caution

When using this filter, fields that were supposed to be hidden will keep their values when editing the entry.
