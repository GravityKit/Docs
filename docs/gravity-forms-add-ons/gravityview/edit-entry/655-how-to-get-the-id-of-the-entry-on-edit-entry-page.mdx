# How to get the ID of the entry on Edit Entry page?

Use the following function to get the currently-edited entry: `gravityview()->request->is_edit_entry()`.

It will return false if not on the Edit Entry screen, or it will return a `\GV\Entry` object. Once you have the `\GV\Entry` object, you can use `$entry->ID` to get the entry ID.

### Here's a sample code:

```php
// Inside a hook during or after `init`

$entry = gravityview()->request->is_edit_entry()

if( $entry ) {
 $entry_id = $entry->ID;
}
```

[See the method in-context.](https://github.com/gravityview/GravityView/blob/master/future/includes/class-gv-request.php#L160-L185)
