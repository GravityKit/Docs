# Modifying the output of the Edit Entry form

If you want to modify how the HTML of the fields render in the Edit Entry form, there's a filter you should use: ` gform_field_content`. The key is to use it inside GravityView; add the filter inside the `gravityview/edit-entry/render/before` action and remove it inside the `gravityview/edit-entry/render/after` action.

### About the `gform_field_content` filter

You can read a full write-up on the filter—including additional examples—on the [Gravity Forms filter documentation page](https://docs.gravityforms.com/gform_field_content/).

### Sample code

Here's an example of using the filter to hide fields that have an empty value:
