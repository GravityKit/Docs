# How does GravityView know who can edit the entry?

GravityView performs two checks before allowing a user to edit an entry on the front end:

###  1. By the entry creator 

By the entry creator: [if the form was submitted while a user was logged in](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/717-understanding-how-an-entry-gets-associated-with-a-user) on the website, then the user ID of this currently logged-in user is stored as entry meta. GravityView will compare this ID stored as an entry meta against the ID of the currently logged-in user. If it matches, then the user can edit the entry.

### 2. By user capability

By a specific user capability: we have a knowledge base article specifically made for this: [Allowing a user to edit all entries](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/291-how-to-allow-a-user-to-edit-all-entries).
