# How to modify the settings for the Post Content edit field

![Screenshot of a Post Content field being edited, with placeholder text in the editor](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/54ff2f5ce4b086c0c096c68b/file-IJ9U2PTbqq.png)

GravityView uses the `wp_editor()` function provided by WordPress to enable rich text editing when editing the Post Content field. **[See what settings are available](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/_wp_editors/parse_settings/)**

If you want to modify the functionality of the editor, you can use the `gravityview/edit_entry/post_content/wp_editor_settings` filter, which accepts the same parameters as the `wp_editor()` function.

### Enable the "Add Media" button

By default, GravityView has the "Add Media" button disabled. To enable it, use the code below:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/460cca23a1598789b1ef.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

###  Disable the Rich Text Editor

If you prefer only to allow editing the text content as HTML, you can also disable the output like so:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/zackkatz/c124236a68b8ad620c00.js" type="text/javascript"></script> There are many settings that you can use to customize the output of the editor. **[See what settings are available](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/classes/_wp_editors/parse_settings/)**
