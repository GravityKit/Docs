# How to prevent an approved entry from being edited

Sometimes we want to prevent an entry from being modified by the user when another person already approves it. That's easily achievable by using a combination of the `[gvlogic]` shortcode, the `{approval_status}` Merge Tag, and the `[gv_entry_link]` shortcode.

Here's how to hide the link to the Edit Entry page using a Custom Content field:

Here's the code we used:

```
[gvlogic if="{approval_status}" isnot="approved"]
	[gv_entry_link action="edit"]
[/gvlogic]
```

Now in our View, we'll only see the Edit Entry link for entries that haven't been approved yet:
