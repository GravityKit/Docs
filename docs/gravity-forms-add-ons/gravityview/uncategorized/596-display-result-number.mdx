# How to display the row number

If your View is showing a dynamic leader board using Gravity Forms data, you would want to have the result number next to each Is it possible to have a column in each row that displays the row number, ie. 1, 2, 3, etc. Would it possible to go a step further and display the same number if it is a tie for the column being used for the sort? ie. 1, 2, 2, 4, 5, etc.
