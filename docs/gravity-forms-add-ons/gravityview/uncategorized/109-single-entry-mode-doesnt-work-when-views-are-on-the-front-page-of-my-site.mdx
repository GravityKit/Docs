# Single entry mode doesn't work when Views are on the front page (home page) of my site


:::caution

 **This issue is fixed in GravityView 1.17.3 and newer.**

:::



WordPress [has a bug](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23867) that prevents Views (and other "Custom Post Types") from working properly on the front page of a website ([learn more about WordPress Static Front Pages](http://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_a_Static_Front_Page#WordPress_Static_Front_Page_Process)).

This bug prevents Single Entries from working when a View is embedded on the front page of a site (or if a View is selected as the front page).

### How to fix this issue

**This fix is not necessary if you run GravityView 1.17.3 and newer.**

Thankfully, the fix is simple: **[download and install this plugin](https://github.com/gravityview/gravityview-front-page-views/archive/master.zip)**. Once installed, links to single entries will work from the front page of your site.
