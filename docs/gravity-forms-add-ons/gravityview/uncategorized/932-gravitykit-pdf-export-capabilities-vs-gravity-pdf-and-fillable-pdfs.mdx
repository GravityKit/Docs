# GravityKit PDF export capabilities vs Gravity PDF and Fillable PDFs

We often get questions about exporting Gravity Forms entries to PDF. In this article, we will briefly discuss the PDF export capabilities of GravityKit plugins and contrast that with two other Gravity Forms PDF add-ons—Gravity PDF and Fillable PDFs.

## GravityKit plugins—PDF capabilities

Our add-on [GravityExport](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravityexport/) allows you to export form entries to PDF using a secure link. You can either export all entries in a single file, or single entries. There are basic customization options like the ability to include certain fields and exclude others. You can also send PDFs to remote storage or attach them to email notifications. [GravityView's DataTables layout](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/datatables/) also includes PDF export functionality. This functionality allows you to export the entries in your View to PDF in tabular format. In both cases, a basic PDF document is generated with entry data, and no special styles are applied.

## Gravity PDF

Gravity PDF allows you to automatically turn individual Gravity Forms entries into PDF documents and attach them to email notifications. You can also use preset templates, and customize/personalize the look and feel of your PDFs.

## Fillable PDFs by CosmicGiant

This plugin allows you to generate fillable PDF documents from Gravity Forms forms. You can also import PDFs and convert them to forms on your website.
