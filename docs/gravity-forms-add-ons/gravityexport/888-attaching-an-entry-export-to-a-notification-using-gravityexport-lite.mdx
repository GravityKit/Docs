# Attaching an entry export to a notification using GravityExport Lite

GravityExport Lite, our free plugin that can be downloaded directly from the [WordPress Plugin Repository](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gf-entries-in-excel/), has this fantastic feature that allows you to attach the export of your newly created entry directly into a [form notification](https://docs.gravityforms.com/configuring-notifications-in-gravity-forms/).

You can select the file type of the export attachment in a CSV or an XLSX format. If you have [GravityExport](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravityexport/) installed, the PDF option also shows up. See [the differences](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/786-how-is-gravityexport-lite-different-from-gravityexport) between the free and the paid version of GravityExport.

To activate this feature, you must first click **Enable Download** on the Settings page of your form inside the GravityExport Lite tab:

Once the download is enabled, on the same page, scroll down to the General Settings section to configure the name of the exported file, its extension, and which notification this file will be attached to:

Now, after every form submission, you'll receive a notification containing the entry export attached, like in this example below:
