# How to re-run a GravityExport Save feed

If you want to re-run a GravityExport Save feed, you can do so in two ways:

## 1. Process a single feed by clicking the action link

Navigate to the feed you would like to re-process. Hover over the single feed, then click the "Process" link.

## 2. Process multiple feeds by performing a bulk action

To process multiple feeds, in the GravityExport Save settings page:

1. Check checkboxes next to feeds you want to reprocess,
2. Select "Process" from the "Bulk actions" dropdown,
3. Click Apply
