# GravityExport: The "Enable multi-row splitting setting" setting

By default, values for fields like the Gravity Forms "List" field or the Gravity Perks "Nested Forms" field get combined into one cell during export. This is often not useful, especially for data analysis.

### With the setting enabled:

| Entry ID | Fruit You Love |
|---|---|
| 1 | Apple, Orange, Grape |
| 2 | Pineapple |
|  |  |

Notice how the multiple fruit values are combined into one row.

### With the "Enable multi-row splitting" setting enabled:

| Entry ID | Fruit You Love |
|---|---|
| 1 | Apple |
| 1 | Orange |
| 1 | Grape |
| 2 | Pineapple |
|  |  |

When using GravityExport, this setting is available in the GravityExport Lite form feed settings in the "Multiple Rows" section.
