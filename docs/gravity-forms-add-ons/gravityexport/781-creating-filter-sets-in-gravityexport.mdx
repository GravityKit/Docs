# Creating "Filter Sets" in GravityExport


:::caution

**Note**: *GravityExport Lite* does not support Filter Sets. This feature is only available in the full version.

:::



Filter sets in GravityExport allow you to configure multiple reports for a single form with different file types and fields.

To create a new filter set, hover over your form in Gravity Forms and click on "Settings".

![The Settings link underneath a form on the Gravity Forms Forms page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/6124b28321ef206e5592e176/file-ml4VSNtpvX.png)

Next, click on the "GravityExport Filters" tab on the left and create a new feed by clicking "Add New".

Now configure the report by giving it a name, selecting a file type, specifying which fields to include, etc.

When you're done, scroll down and click "Save Settings". You will now see a download URL for your new report at the top. You can copy the URL by clicking "Copy URL to clipboard" at the bottom right.

You can create as many different filter sets as you need.
