# Changing the File Format of a Report by Adding the File Extension to the URL

To change the file format of a report, all you need to do is add your desired file extension (".pdf", ".csv", or ".xlsx") to the end of the download URL.


:::info

**Note**: This works with any download URL generated by GravityExport.

:::

  When creating a new export feed, the plugin will generate a download URL for you.

You will then need to choose a file extension.

However, regardless of the extension you choose, you may change the format of the report by simply adding a different file extension to the end of the URL, like this:

This works for any supported file type!
