# Connecting FTP to GravityExport


:::caution

**Note**: *GravityExport Lite* does not support FTP export. This feature is only available in the full version.

:::



GravityExport allows you to save entries to a remote FTP server. Follow these steps to connect GravityExport to FTP.

## 1. Find Your FTP Details

You should be able to find your FTP login details from inside your hosting account. Copy these details for later.

## 2. Create a New "GravityExport Save" Feed

Log in to your WordPress website, hover over *Forms,* and click *Forms*. Next, hover over your form and click *Settings*. Now click on the tab that says "GravityExport Save" and click *Add New* to create a new feed.
