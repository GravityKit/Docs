# How to manually trigger a GravityExport Save Feed

You can manually trigger a GravityExport Save feed by calling a public URL. If you want to trigger the feed to run on a schedule, you can do so using a cron job (more on this below).

When creating a new "GravityExport Save" feed, select the "Manual trigger" option under "Export trigger". After saving the feed, a public trigger URL will be generated. Click on the button to copy this URL to your clipboard.

## Scheduling exports

If you want to schedule exports to run at certain times, you'll need to call the generated public trigger URL using a cron service. This will ensure that your Save feed is executed at defined time intervals.

If your website receives a decent amount of traffic, we recommend using the free [WP Crontrol plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-crontrol/). This allows you to manage cron schedules through your WordPress website. However, it's important to note that running cron through WordPress [is not always reliable](https://github.com/johnbillion/wp-crontrol/wiki/Cron-events-that-have-missed-their-schedule).

Alternatively, you'll need to use a separate cron service. If your hosting provider does not support this, check out [this list of free and paid cron services](https://www.cronjobservices.com/).

For more information about cron jobs, [see this comprehensive tutorial for beginners](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/cron-job).
