# Connecting Dropbox to GravityExport



:::caution

**Note**: *GravityExport Lite* does not support Dropbox export. This feature is only available in [the full version of GravityExport](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/gravityexport/).

:::

  In GravityExport 1.1 we made it easier and more secure to link your Dropbox account with GravityExport. To connect your Dropbox account, follow the steps below:

Hover over "GravityKit" and click "Settings". Next, click on "GravityExport" and then "Connect to Dropbox". You'll now be taken to Dropbox to complete the connection.

Dropbox will display a notice asking if you're sure you want to proceed. Click "Continue".
