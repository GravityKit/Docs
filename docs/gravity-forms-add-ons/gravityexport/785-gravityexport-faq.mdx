# GravityExport FAQ

## Is GravityExport Lite required for GravityExport?

Yes, GravityExport currently requires Lite to be installed and activated. If it's not, you will be shown messages guiding you to install and activate [GravityExport Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gf-entries-in-excel/).

## Do downloads from GravityExport Filters links count toward the "Download count" value?

Yes, when you download an export file using URLs generated by the GravityExport Filters feeds, it will increment the download counter.

## Why arenâ€™t Merge Tags working for my "Custom Filename" setting in the GravityExport Save feed?

Most likely, you have configured the feed to be "All Entries". In "All Entries", limited Merge Tags are available. No Merge Tags related to values from a single entry are enabled.
