# How to enable or disable GravityEdit per-field

You can define what fields are editable on the front end when [using GravityEdit with GravityView](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/422-enable-inline-edit-for-gravityview). Disabling field editing is unavailable when using GravityEdit in the Gravity Forms Entries screen.

By default, editing fields will be enabled when the "Enable Inline Edit" View setting is checked. ![Screenshot of the Settings box when editing a View. A green arrow points to the 'Enable Inline Edit' setting, which is checked.](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Markup-2022-01-14-at-09.58.40.png)

When the GravityEdit is enabled, you will see a pencil icon next to the field label in GravityView. ![Close-up screenshot of fields in GravityView, each with a pencil icon next to the their label.](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Screenshot-on-2022-01-14-at-10-13-34.png)

## How to disable GravityEdit for a field

**Click the field settings icon** (a gear cog) next to the field for which you want to disable editing.

In the Advanced section, there is a setting named "Enable Editing This Field With Inline Edit". **Click the "Disabled" option to prevent editing.**

**Close the field settings** by clicking the "Close" button or outside the field settings container. Youâ€™ll notice that the pencil icon is no longer next to the field label, showing that GravityEdit is disabled.

**Save the View!** In the Publish box, click the Update button to save the View.
