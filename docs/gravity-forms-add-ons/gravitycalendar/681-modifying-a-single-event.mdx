# Modifying event colors


:::info

Note: This document is intended for developers familiar with PHP. If you have a question, please [ask support](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/).

In 1.3.1, GravityCalendar added the `gravityview/calendar/events` filter to modify the events array passed to FullCalendar.

Using this filter, you can loop through each event and modify its properties. You can add any properties that are available on the [FullCalendar Event Object](https://fullcalendar.io/docs/event-object).

## Changing event colors based on their type

In the example below, we'll change the color of the events based on their type. Type is a dropdown field we added to our form:

### Example code

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rafaehlers/5086fe06adf6aa9c33f469c0f3287623.js" type="text/javascript"></script>

### The final Calendar with different event colors
