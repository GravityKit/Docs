# Linking an Event to a Single Entry Page


:::info

**Note:** Linking a calendar event to the Single Entry page requires you to have [GravityView](https://www.gravitykit.com/features/) installed with a View linked to your events form.

### Prefer to Watch the Video?

If you're using the GravityCalendar plugin to display events, you may want to add a link to the Single Entry page where users can view more information about the event.

Here's how to create a link from the event tooltip to the [Single Entry page](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/734-getting-started-adding-fields-to-the-multiple-entries-and-single-entry-pages) of a View:

###  1. Open Your GravityCalendar Feed Settings

To open the Calendar Feed Settings page, edit your form in Gravity Forms, click on *Settings* at the top, and select the GravityCalendar tab on the left. Find your feed and click on Edit.

Now scroll down to the *Event Description* box under *Calendar Fields.*

### 2. Add the \[gv\_entry\_link\] Shortcode to the Event Description

Now create a simple "Read more" link using the [\[gv\_entry\_link\] shortcode](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/287-gv-entry-link):

![The Calendar Event Description box containing the gv_entry_link shortcode](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/619f5f4bd3efbe495c3b29dd/file-pmwz94VZx2.png)

Here is the shortcode:

```

[gv_entry_link view_id="374" entry_id="{entry_id}"]Read more[/gv_entry_link]
```

Be sure to update the `view_id` and feel free to modify the words "Read more" to something else.

### 3. Enable the Allow HTML Content option

This option must be enabled; otherwise, you won't have a clickable link created by the \[gv\_entry\_link\] shortcode.

![Screenshot of the Allow HTML Content option](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/63586aa62a22cc147576ccfc/file-oi33OpkyQS.png)

When users click "Read more", they'll be taken to the Single Entry page, where they can view more details about the event.
