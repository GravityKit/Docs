# My Calendar Isn't Displaying

If you're experiencing problems with your calendar (such as it not displaying properly or disappearing), it may be due to a plugin conflict with the " [Essential Addons for Elementor](<https://essential-addons.com/elementor/ >)" plugin.

The Essential Addons for Elementor plugin includes an Event Calendar element. This loads the same [calendar library](https://fullcalendar.io) as our GravityCalendar add-on, which causes issues. To avoid any conflicts, disable this element.
