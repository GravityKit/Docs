# Can I book an appointment with GravityCalendar?

**Short answer**: Unfortunately, no.

**Long answer**: Our [GravityCalendar](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/calendar/) add-on is similar to a [GravityView View layout](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/317-how-to-change-the-view-layout); it allows you to display your form submissions on the front end in a calendar format by using a date field on your form.

Here's a live example: [https://site.try.gravitykit.com/calendar/](https://site.try.gravitykit.com/calendar/)

However, this plugin doesn't have any booking functionalities that can be used on your form. For that feature, we recommend two plugins: [gAppointments](https://codecanyon.net/item/gappointments-appointment-booking-addon-for-gravity-forms/21216523) and [Gravity Forms Inventory](https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-inventory/) by GravityWiz.
