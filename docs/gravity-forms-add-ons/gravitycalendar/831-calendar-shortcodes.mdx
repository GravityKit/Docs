# Calendar Shortcodes

As of version 2.0, GravityCalendar now supports four different shortcodes. Each shortcode requires the `id` parameter to work.

###  \[gravitycalendar\]

This shortcode allows you to embed a calendar on your website.

### \[gravitycalendar\_link\]

This shortcode will display a subscription link, allowing users to subscribe to your calendar feed using Google Calendar or Apple Calendar. The feed will update in real-time, ensuring events are always up-to-date. Requires GravityCalendar 2.0 or later.

### \[gravitycalendar\_copy\_button\]

This shortcode will display a button that allows users to copy your calendar feed URL to their clipboard. The calendar feed URL is a live-updating link that displays information about your calendar events in real time. Requires GravityCalendar 2.0 or later.

### \[gravitycalendar\_export\_button\]

This shortcode will display a button that allows users to export an event configuration file ( `.ics` file) that they can import into any calendar application. Requires GravityCalendar 2.0 or later.

**Note**: If you're unsure what the difference is between subscribing to a calendar feed and importing events from a `.ics` file, read [this article](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/829-subscribing-vs-downloading).

 ### How to Find the ID of Your Calendar Feed

To find your calendar feed ID, go to the **Forms** page in Gravity Forms. Next, hover over your form and click on the **Calendar Feeds** link. Now, click on the **GravityCalendar** tab on the left to see a list of your calendar feeds for that form. In the **Shortcode** column, you'll see the `[gravitycalendar]` shortcode with the `id` parameter prefilled.
