# How can I change the day weeks start on in Calendar?

!["Week Starts On" setting](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/61b8fa85372a8f501c4a1f06/file-8tk5rp9y5L.png)For the [GravityCalendar add-on](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/calendar/), by default, the week starts on the same day as the value of the "Week Starts On" setting configured in WordPress.

The settings can be accessed by clicking on Settings in the sidebar in the WordPress dashboard, then clicking on "General".
