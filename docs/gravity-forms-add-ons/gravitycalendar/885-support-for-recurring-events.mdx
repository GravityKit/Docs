# Support for recurring events

GravityCalendar is similar to a [View layout](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/735-getting-started-choosing-a-form-and-a-view-layout): it displays your form entries (events) on a Calendar layout. [See a demo here](https://site.try.gravitykit.com/calendar/).

To have a recurring event, it would require multiple entries with different start and end dates. That's a job for a special form field, not the Calendar itself.

We hope to introduce this functionality in the future. If you are interested in this type of functionality, [let us know](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/).
