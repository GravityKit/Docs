# Calendar Setting: "No Current Events Behavior"

### When displaying a calendar of entries, sometimes there are no entries to show!

You can control what happens when there are no entries by using the "No Current Events Behavior" setting, added in GravityCalendar version 1.2.

- **Stay on Today (Show Current Calendar)** The calendar will start on the current date.
- **Show Last Event**  
    The calendar will start on the date of the most recent event in the **past**. If there are no past events, the current date will be shown.
- **Show Next Event**  
    The calendar will start on the date of the next event in the **future**. If there are no future events, the current date will be shown.
