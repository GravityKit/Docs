# Displaying a Calendar


:::info

If you haven't already, please [create a calendar](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/650-creating-a-calendar) first.

:::



You can display the calendar on your site using many ways:

- [Shortcode](#shortcode)
- [WordPress widget](#wp-widget)
- [Gutenberg block](#block)
- [GravityView widget](#gv-widget)

## Shortcode

To access your calendar's shortcode, navigate to the Forms list, hover over the form record, and click on the Calendar Feeds link:

In the feeds table, copy your calendar's shortcode listed in the `Shortcode` column and use it inside a `Post` or elsewhere on your site:

## WordPress Widget

To configure a WordPress widget, navigate to the `Widgets` area under `Appearance`, locate and click on `GravityCalendar,` then click on the `Add Widget` button:

Once the Widget is added to the list, you need to configure it by selecting a `Form` and `Feed` (i.e., calendar), and then press the `Save` button:

## Gutenberg Block

To add a Gutenberg Block, edit an existing or create a new post by clicking `Add New` option under `Posts`, clicking on the `+` sign to add a new Gutenberg block, type "Calendar" on the input box to quickly locate the GravityCalendar blocks, and then select GravityCalendar from the list of available blocks:

Once the Block is added, you will have to select a `Form` and `Feed` (i.e., calendar) from the Block settings to render the calendar preview in the editor.

## GravityView Widget

If you have an active [GravityView](https://www.gravitykit.com/features/) installation, you can embed a calendar in your View (read about [setting up a View](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/380-how-to-setup-your-first-view)) by using the `+ Add Widget` button and selecting `Calendar`:

Once the widget is added, click on the settings cog icon to configure the calendar:

You can choose to display events for all View entries or limit them to only those entries shown on the page. Make sure to publish or update your View to save the changes.


:::note

When used as a GravityView Widget, the calendar will inherit the [View's settings](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/382-the-view-settings-meta-box). What you see in the calendar preview (under Form Settings â†’ GravityCalendar Feed) could be different from the final output if you configured [Advanced Filter](https://www.gravitykit.com/extensions/advanced-filter/) conditions, limited display to only approved entries or changed other options that control how entries are shown.
