# Bulk Edit Step: What will happen to my old field data?

## Existing values will be overwritten with new values you define here.

- If you leave the field blank, field values will be deleted.
- **ðŸš¨ Edits are final!** Once you process a bulk edit, previous entry data will be overwritten.
- No "undo" or entry revisions will be created.

### The GravityRevisions plugin will not create revisions from bulk edits.

Because of the way edits are made, the Entry Revisions plugin is unable to log these changes. **Bulk edits are final**â€”if you're concerned about data loss, please back up your entry data first!
