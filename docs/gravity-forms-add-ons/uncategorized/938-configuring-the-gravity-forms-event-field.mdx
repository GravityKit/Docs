# Configuring the Gravity Forms Event field

In this article, we will walk you through configuring the Gravity Forms "Event" field.

The Event field is a free add-on that we developed for use with our GravityCalendar add-on. The Event field makes it easier to create events in Gravity Forms by bundling multiple input fields into a single form field.

The Event field can be found under "Advanced Fields" in the form editor.
