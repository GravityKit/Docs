# The "Download failed. Unauthorized" message

If you're trying to update a plugin and receive the message "Download failed. Unauthorized", first make sure your license is active.

#### [Here's how to activate your license.](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/453-activating-your-license)

If your license is active, then the problem is likely that you are running on a testing site and haven't activated the license on a non-test site yet.

A test site is a site that is running on a local development computer, and has "debug", "testing", and similar words in the domain.

If this is the case, please [contact support](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/) with your test site URL, and we will activate your URL manually.
