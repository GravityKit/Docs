### Manage Active Sites

GravityKit licenses come with a fixed number of domains on which they can be activated. If you want to deactivate a domain, you can do on the *Settings* page of the GravityView plugin.

However, if you have previously transferred a, this won't work. In cases like these, you can manage your activated domains from your GravityKit Account page.

#### 1. Your activated sites are shown below your license key.

2. To deactivate a site, Click on the "x" next to the domain you want to deactivate.
