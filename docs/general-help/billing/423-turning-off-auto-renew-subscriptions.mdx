# Turning off auto-renew subscriptions

If you prefer to renew your subscriptions manually, it's easy!

**First, [visit the GravityKit Account page](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/)**.

### Log in to your GravityKit Account

### The page will reload, and you will see a message

![The subscription has been cancelled. When your license expires, it will not automatically renew.](https://www.gravitykit.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/the-subscription-has-been-cancelled-when-your-license-expires-it-will-not-automatically-renew.png?1501123335)

The message will confirm that your subscription has been canceled. Your license will no longer automatically renew, which means each time you would like to renew your license, you will need to go through the checkout process again.
