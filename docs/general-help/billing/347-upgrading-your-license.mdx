# Upgrading your license


:::info

You can upgrade your license at any time by paying just **the difference in cost**.

:::



First, access your [GravityKit Account page](https://www.gravitykit.com/account/).

On your GravityKit Account page. If you are able to upgrade, the upgrade options will appear on the "Your Licenses" tab under "Upgrades". Click the link to upgrade.

Once you click the link, you will be taken to GravityKit's cart page.

<pclass>You'll notice the upgrade price is applied to the cart. ![Screenshot showing the cart with the price of the upgrade](https://s3.amazonaws.com/helpscout.net/docs/assets/54c58489e4b051242988532c/images/634f549c4d805871ceaa48a0/file-Gh4yfFrUnc.png)
