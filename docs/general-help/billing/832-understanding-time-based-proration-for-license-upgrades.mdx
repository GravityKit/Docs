# Understanding Time-Based Proration for License Upgrades

When you buy any product from GravityKit, you can [upgrade your license](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/347-upgrading-your-license) anytime. The amount you pay for the upgrade will be **prorated based on how long you have left on your current license**. When there are less than 90 days remaining in your license, the upgrade price will be the difference between the two licenses.

In other words, you will pay the difference in cost between the two licenses as a prorated amount based on the time you have left on the current license.

### Prorated pricing example

Let's say you have a GravityKit Core license which costs $69/year, and you want to upgrade to All Access ($399/year), but you still have 219 days left on your current billing cycle (you've had your current license for 146 days). When upgrading, you will pay the price difference multiplied by the remaining time in the license. Here's math illustrating this example:

1. **<tt>$399 - $69 = $330</tt>**   
    *The price difference is $330*
2. **<tt>1 - ( 146 / 365 ) = .6</tt>** *146 days (40%) of the current billing period have been used; 60% of the billing period remains*
3. **<tt>$330 \* .6 = $198</tt>**   
    *The cost of the prorated upgrade is the price difference multiplied by the remaining time in the billing period*

Note: When the upgraded license renews, the renewal price is the total cost of the All Access license ($399).

### Upgrade pricing within 90 days of renewal

Within 90 days of license renewal, the math is simple! You pay the difference in price between the licenses.

1. **<tt>$399 - $69 = $330</tt>**   
    *The price difference is $330*

When upgrading, the license renewal date will be updated to be one year from your upgrade date.
