# Hard-coding your license key

If you want your GravityKit's license key to pre-populate when a new site is created on a Multi-Site installation, you can define a `GRAVITYKIT_LICENSES` constant.

### Add the following to your `wp-config.php` file:

```
define( 'GRAVITYKIT_LICENSES', 'YOUR_KEY_HERE' );
```

You can also specify more than one license this way:

```
define( 'GRAVITYKIT_LICENSES', [ 'FIRST_KEY', 'SECOND_KEY' ] );
```

:::

  Since October 2022, all of GravityKit's products have been updated to use a [new license management system](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/876-managing-your-licenses). License keys are encrypted before being stored in the database and are never exposed to the user in WordPress's admin dashboard. While using a constant as described above will make your keys visible to those with access to `wp-config.php`, license keys will still be stored encrypted in the database and masked when displayed to users.
