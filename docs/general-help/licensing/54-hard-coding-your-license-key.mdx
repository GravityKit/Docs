# Hard-coding your license key

If you want your GravityKit's license key to pre-populate when a new site is created on a Multi-Site installation, you can define a `GRAVITYKIT_LICENSES` constant.

### Add the following to your `wp-config.php` file:

```
const GRAVITYKIT_LICENSES = 'YOUR_KEY_HERE';
```

You can also specify more than one license this way:

```
const GRAVITYKIT_LICENSES = ['FIRST_KEY','SECOND_KEY'];
```

:::

  Since October 2022, we have updated all our add-ons with a [new license management system](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/876-managing-your-licenses), so license keys are now stored encrypted in the database and are never exposed to the user on the dashboard. When using a constant, like in the examples above, those will be the only instance where license keys won't be encrypted.
