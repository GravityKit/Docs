# Development websites and GravityKit licenses

When you're developing a website, you want to make sure you're running the latest version of plugins. We encourage you to [activate your GravityKit license](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/876-managing-your-licenses) on all your staging and development sites.

When you activate your sites, GravityKit plugins won't count development or staging websites against your license count. Even better: this happens automatically! If you activate GravityView or any of our plugins on `staging.example.com` or `dev.example.com`, or even `localhost.local` (as examples), it won't count against your site totals.

If our plugins don't automatically recognize that your site is a staging or development website, [let us know](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/), and we will increase your activation limit.
