# Multisite and GravityKit Licenses

**If you network-activate** any GravityKit plugins on a Multisite network, it counts as a single activation.

**If you <u>don't</u> network-activate** GravityKit, each site will count against the license limits. You will also need to activate the plugin on each site individually.

**Please note:** a license is for a single person to contact support. If you run a network, each site should not contact support; they should contact you (the license holder), and you should then contact GravityKit support on their behalf.
