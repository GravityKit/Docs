# Products show as unlicensed

If you have an active license key and the associated products appear as unlicensed, we recommend that you attempt to [forcibly remove](https://docs.gravitykit.com/article/921-cant-deactivate-license-key) and re-add your license key.  
  
If the problem persists, please [contact our support team](https://www.gravitykit.com/support) for further assistance.
