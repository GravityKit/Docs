# Downgrading your license

Unfortunately, our system doesn't allow downgrading from an All Access or GravityView + Extensions Bundle license to a lower level. As such, you'll need to purchase a separate one.

### **Want to downgrade?**

- **If your license is expired,** simply purchase a new one at your desired level.
- **If <u>less</u> than 30 days have passed since your initial purchase,** please [contact us](https://www.gravitykit.com/support/). Unfortunately, downgrading is not possible. Instead, we'll refund you and then have you purchase your desired license level.

**Reminder:** After you purchase a new license, remember to first deactivate your website on the account page of your old license.
